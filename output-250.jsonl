{"question":"What is emphasized as the key factor in a startup idea according to the text?","answer":"Having something your friends actually want.","chunk":"What you need in a startup idea, and all you need, is something your friends actually want. And those ideas aren't hard to see once you're good at technology. There are sticking doors everywhere.","chunk_id":"bd3afdf8933edef19ce4d1a61b547a93"}
{"question":"According to the text, where do many startup cofounders come from?","answer":"Many startup cofounders come from universities.","chunk":"You don't have to start a startup with someone you meet at university. The founders of Twitch met when they were seven. The founders of Stripe, Patrick and John Collison, met when John was born. But universities are the main source of cofounders. And because they're where the cofounders are, they're also where the ideas are, because the best ideas grow out of projects you do with the people who become your cofounders.","chunk_id":"708d5f638252ac76efe52388ffb7df2e"}
{"question":"What was the author's experience like as a PhD student in computer science according to the text?","answer":"The author was working on multiple projects that were not their thesis while being in a PhD program in computer science.","chunk":"So now I was in a PhD program in computer science, yet planning to be an artist, yet also genuinely in love with Lisp hacking and working away at On Lisp. In other words, like many a grad student, I was working energetically on multiple projects that were not my thesis.","chunk_id":"da18f36e30f40bea2b4fe1c82bc9742f"}

{"question":"What does the current education system steer individuals towards in terms of work attitudes, according to the text?","answer":"The current education system steers individuals towards dutiful and plodding work, often using competition as bait, and away from skating.","chunk":"It may be inevitable that school is the way it is. I'm not saying we have to redesign it (though I'm not saying we don't), just that we should understand what it does to our attitudes to work â€” that it steers us toward the dutiful plodding kind of work, often using competition as bait, and away from skating.","chunk_id":"7c8714e01f8eaacc42b1a1fbb6d7cc88"}
{"question":"According to the text, how can people be classified based on their mindset and behavior?","answer":"People can be classified based on how independent- or conventional-minded they are, and how aggressive they are about it.","chunk":"I've already written an essay describing the aggressively conventional-minded. The short version is that people can be classified in two dimensions according to (1) how independent- or conventional-minded they are, and (2) how aggressive they are about it. The aggressively conventional-minded are the enforcers of orthodoxy.","chunk_id":"8132f7de8a4f4de025843eccd04cc7ee"}

This impressive-sounding thing called an \"internet storefront\" was something we already knew how to build.","chunk_id":"9579286b6ad3a36624b6fc7ac20d7036"}
{"question":"How can work compound indirectly according to the text?","answer":"Work can compound indirectly through learning, as learning compounds.","chunk":"There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless.","chunk_id":"297e3ccff3010cafe2293d3fc7e480b0"}
{"question":"What features must an ideology have to unite the conventional-minded according to the text?","answer":"An ideology must have strict and arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their purity by obeying, and its adherents must believe that anyone who obeys these rules is morally superior.","chunk":"To unite the conventional-minded, an ideology must have many of the features of a religion. In particular it must have strict and arbitrary rules that adherents can demonstrate their purity by obeying, and its adherents must believe that anyone who obeys these rules is ipso facto morally superior to anyone who doesn't.","chunk_id":"e5c91bc65170b40e88d856f06f7e99c8"}
{"question":"What would be proportional to performance p over time t if growth rate were proportional to performance?","answer":"The reward for performance p over time t would be proportional to pt.","chunk":"YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate \"you get out what you put in,\" but it's not far from the truth. And if growth rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance p over time t would be proportional to pt.","chunk_id":"2ac49f59717bb978aec9ae1e37ef44eb"}
{"question":"Why do we lack customs about exponential growth according to the text?","answer":"We lack customs about exponential growth because there have been few instances of it in human history, herding being a potential example limited by grazing land.","chunk":"What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially.","chunk_id":"df602c06b072a9ee919034b1903bad01"}
{"question":"What correlation does the text suggest between successful startups and the universities their founders attended?","answer":"The text suggests a correlation between successful startups and the universities their founders attended, indicating that the largest numbers of successful startups come from the same list of the most selective universities.","chunk":"The empirical evidence is clear on this. If you look at where the largest numbers of successful startups come from, it's pretty much the same as the list of the most selective universities.","chunk_id":"7983241d508741e75f046023b7419e9c"}
{"question":"What does the text mention as an extreme example of starting a company?","answer":"Starting Google is mentioned as an extreme example of starting a company in the text.","chunk":"Starting your own company can mean anything from starting a barber shop to starting Google.

{"question":"What are some factors contributing to the ease of starting a startup now according to the text?","answer":"The factors contributing to the ease of starting a startup now include social acceptance, knowledge dissemination, and cost reduction due to technology.","chunk":"Part of the reason it's getting easier to start a startup is social. Society is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, your parents won't freak out the way they would have a generation ago, and knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But the main reason it's easier to start a startup now is that it's cheaper. Technology has driven down the cost of both building products and acquiring customers.","chunk_id":"f55f08dc12e7731c198ec2bc38eb8050"}
{"question":"What does the text suggest about the rate of change in the world and the returns for performance?","answer":"The text suggests that the rate of change in the world has been dramatic by historical standards, and a fundamental change is observed in the returns for performance.","chunk":"There's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change has been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering what's at stake. It's hard to imagine a more fundamental change than one in the returns for performance.","chunk_id":"00c4c8028a3f27f191d0342117cbf401"}
{"question":"What was the main goal of Mao in initiating the Cultural Revolution?","answer":"Mao initiated the Cultural Revolution to undermine his rivals and encouraged people to seek out heretics among them.","chunk":"The most notorious 20th century case may have been the Cultural Revolution. Though initiated by Mao to undermine his rivals, the Cultural Revolution was otherwise mostly a grass-roots phenomenon. Mao said in essence: There are heretics among us. Seek them out and punish them. And that's all the aggressively conventional-minded ever need to hear. They went at it with the delight of dogs chasing squirrels.","chunk_id":"ce94204a7d57b8814417ab42e021aabb"}
{"question":"What heuristic does the text suggest regarding learning and exponential growth?","answer":"The text suggests the heuristic of always be learning to achieve superlinear returns.","chunk":"Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.","chunk_id":"1da26f4497b8e6a39455251021c98d61"}
{"question":"According to the text, how can one get good at technology?","answer":"One can get good at technology by practicing, similar to how one masters skills in other fields like playing the violin or football.","chunk":"So that's the first of the three things you need, to get good at some kind or kinds of technology. You do it the same way you get good at the violin or football: practice. If you start a startup at 22, and you start writing your own programs now, then by the time you start the company you'll have spent at least 7 years practicing writing code, and you can get pretty good at anything after practicing it for 7 years.","chunk_id":"7f3083273890cc5b640214085104b40d"}
{"question":"What is described as a potential startup idea in the text?","answer":"The things that are missing from the technology itself and all the broken things that could be fixed using it.","chunk":"Actually it's easy to get startup ideas once you're good at technology. Once you're good at some technology, when you look at the world you see dotted outlines around the things that are missing. You start to be able to see both the things that are missing from the technology itself, and all the broken things that could be fixed using it, and each one of these is a potential startup.","chunk_id":"64135aeb363911fea8510bbea00a38fe"}
{"question":"What are the two reasons mentioned in the text for a phenomenon, and how are they described?","answer":"The two reasons mentioned in the text are progress in technology and the decreasing importance of organizations. They are closely intertwined, almost like one and a half reason.","chunk":"There are two reasons for this, though they're so closely intertwined that they're more like one and a half: progress in technology, and the decreasing importance of organizations.","chunk_id":"7a0a97dda51adef5653c6fd336818825"}
{"question":"What impact did making everyone a corporate employee have on economic inequality according to the text?","answer":"Making everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality.","chunk":"Making everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality (and every other kind of variation), but if your model of normal is the mid 20th century, you have a very misleading model in that respect. J. P. Morgan's economy turned out to be just a phase, and starting in the 1970s, it began to break up.","chunk_id":"92fc9e9c95508baa89226b86cdee1c2f"}
{"question":"What is the recommended approach to becoming skilled in technology and selecting which technology to focus on, according to the text?","answer":"The recommended approach is to work on your own projects based on your interests, rather than trying to predict the most valuable technology to know about.","chunk":"How do you get good at technology? And how do you choose which technology to get good at? Both of those questions turn out to have the same answer: work on your own projects. Don't try to guess whether gene editing or LLMs or rockets will turn out to be the most valuable technology to know about. No one can predict that. Just work on whatever interests you the most. You'll work much harder on something you're interested in than something you're doing because you think you're supposed to.","chunk_id":"3bb3e61a043cd396acc7669d021ab532"}
{"question":"Why did the author initially plan to study philosophy in college?","answer":"The author initially planned to study philosophy in college because it seemed to be the study of ultimate truths compared to other fields which were perceived as mere domain knowledge.","chunk":"Though I liked programming, I didn't plan to study it in college. In college I was going to study philosophy, which sounded much more powerful. It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge. What I discovered when I got to college was that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't much left for these supposed ultimate truths. All that seemed left for philosophy were edge cases that people in other fields felt could safely be ignored.","chunk_id":"b0e006e27bfbfa7db821c378da5fbce4"}
{"question":"What is the standard way to get really rich, as mentioned in the text?","answer":"Starting one's own company is the standard way to get really rich, according to the text.","chunk":"It's more exciting to work on your own project than someone else's. And you can also get a lot richer. In fact, this is the standard way to get really rich. If you look at the lists of the richest people that occasionally get published in the press, nearly all of them did it by starting their own companies.","chunk_id":"de494946e19340c348b991e5845cd8c4"}
{"question":"Why does every child find exponential growth surprising, according to the text?","answer":"Every child finds exponential growth surprising because it is not natural and is illustrated by the story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double the amount each successive day.","chunk":"Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double the amount each successive day.","chunk_id":"62d8a7d19a43298b6cda2a2349adc1ae"}
{"question":"According to the text, what analogy is used to illustrate the consequences of committing a crime?","answer":"The analogy used is that committing a crime is similar to facing the penalty of the law, regardless of one's previous virtuous life.","chunk":"It's much the same as if you committed a crime. No matter how virtuously you've lived, if you commit a crime, you must still suffer the penalty of the law. Having lived a previously blameless life might mitigate the punishment, but it doesn't affect whether you're guilty or not.","chunk_id":"c32093f751ef92a7fdf39f8a1eaea569"}
{"question":"What is emphasized in the text regarding the preservation of excitement while working on a personal project within a large organization?","answer":"The text emphasizes the importance of preserving the excitement of working on a personal project within a large organization. It suggests that successful organizations have techniques to maintain this excitement for a considerable period.","chunk":"These two paths into collaboration can of course be combined. But under the right conditions, the excitement of working on a project of one's own can be preserved for quite a while before disintegrating into the turbulent flow of work in a large organization. Indeed, the history of successful organizations is partly the history of techniques for preserving that excitement.","chunk_id":"ea479916aa5e8529ce46dbf04ea686b3"}
{"question":"How did Apple transition from a project to a company?","answer":"Apple transitioned from a project to a company when Steve Jobs proposed selling plans for the computer Steve Wozniak built to other people.","chunk":"Facebook was not unusual in this respect. Apple and Google also began as projects. Apple wasn't meant to be a company. Steve Wozniak just wanted to build his own computer. It only turned into a company when Steve Jobs said \"Hey, I wonder if we could sell plans for this computer to other people.\" That's how Apple started. They weren't even selling computers, just plans for computers. Can you imagine how lame this company seemed?","chunk_id":"eb3d178c5b1595e38d04de39d1a1de54"}
{"question":"What realization did the author have while looking at a painting at the Carnegie Institute in 1988?","answer":"The author realized that paintings could last for hundreds of years, unlike technology that becomes obsolete.","chunk":"In this dissatisfied state I went in 1988 to visit Rich Draves at CMU, where he was in grad school. One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete. Some of the best ones were hundreds of years old.","chunk_id":"4616fa5a469be1fe9240e942b2466a7e"}
{"question":"Who showed the author the World Wide Web in Cambridge?","answer":"Robert Morris","chunk":"Meanwhile I'd been hearing more and more about this new thing called the World Wide Web. Robert Morris showed it to me when I visited him in Cambridge, where he was now in grad school at Harvard. It seemed to me that the web would be a big deal. I'd seen what graphical user interfaces had done for the popularity of microcomputers. It seemed like the web would do the same for the internet.","chunk_id":"09717cb44decd73783a2039be59f6d8f"}
{"question":"What types of schoolwork became personal projects for the author?","answer":"Writing papers in English classes and writing programs in CS classes became personal projects for the author.","chunk":"There are occasionally times when schoolwork becomes a project of one's own. Whenever I had to write a paper, that would become a project of my own â€” except in English classes, ironically, because the things one has to write in English classes are so bogus. And when I got to college and started taking CS classes, the programs I had to write became projects of my own. Whenever I was writing or programming, I was usually skating, and that has been true ever since.","chunk_id":"b55817279277555e712b129b3ad08b41"}
{"question":"Why is it good to learn about multiple things according to the text?","answer":"It's good to learn about multiple things because it helps in gaining valuable knowledge and skills, as demonstrated by Steve Jobs who learned about calligraphy and electronics.","chunk":"You don't have to do just one project. In fact it's good to learn about multiple things. Steve Jobs didn't just learn calligraphy. He also learned about electronics, which was even more valuable. Whatever you're interested in. (Do you notice a theme here?)","chunk_id":"110ccf8b32d476c82e371b8f0edd89c2"}
{"question":"What neighborhood in New York City did the author move to and describe as not being wealthy in 1993?","answer":"Yorkville","chunk":"Asterix comics begin by zooming in on a tiny corner of Roman Gaul that turns out not to be controlled by the Romans. You can do something similar on a map of New York City: if you zoom in on the Upper East Side, there's a tiny corner that's not rich, or at least wasn't in 1993. It's called Yorkville, and that was my new home. Now I was a New York artist â€” in the strictly technical sense of making paintings and living in New York.","chunk_id":"4df964981241bde0f159e09a0ec203f6"}
{"question":"What type of program did the author write for his father to use?","answer":"A word processor.","chunk":"Computers were expensive in those days and it took me years of nagging before I convinced my father to buy one, a TRS-80, in about 1980. The gold standard then was the Apple II, but a TRS-80 was good enough. This was when I really started programming. I wrote simple games, a program to predict how high my model rockets would fly, and a word processor that my father used to write at least one book. There was only room in memory for about 2 pages of text, so he'd write 2 pages at a time and then print them out, but it was a lot better than a typewriter.","chunk_id":"ea91d2c9446ef0bb9c43b8da55c0918a"}
{"question":"What tactic do heretic hunters often use when criticized for their suppression of ideas?","answer":"Heretic hunters often accuse those who criticize their suppression of ideas as heretics themselves.","chunk":"I've deliberately avoided mentioning any specific heresies here. Partly because one of the universal tactics of heretic hunters, now as in the past, is to accuse those who disapprove of the way in which they suppress ideas of being heretics themselves. Indeed, this tactic is so consistent that you could use it as a way of detecting witch hunts in any era.","chunk_id":"f0ae1efe35cf6ec1db787194609b5241"}
{"question":"According to the text, what is a more effective way to learn programming than attending a class?","answer":"Working on your own projects is a faster way to learn programming than attending a class.","chunk":"If you really want to learn to program, you have to work on your own projects. You learn so much faster that way. Imagine you're writing a game and there's something you want to do in it, and you don't know how.

{"question":"What role does luck play in success, according to the text?","answer":"Luck is a significant factor in success, particularly when working independently.","chunk":"And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component of true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking risks early.","chunk_id":"c6e3dba2cc1f38b704ec6437eec9fb23"}
{"question":"What is the 'secret curse' of the nonprofit world mentioned in the text?","answer":"The 'secret curse' of the nonprofit world is restricted donations.","chunk":"The secret curse of the nonprofit world is restricted donations.

{"question":"In what areas of life do we observe superlinear returns for performance according to the text?","answer":"Fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and benefit to humanity.","chunk":"It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer.","chunk_id":"7328e00298d2c1298c2e73bc1bf27c65"}
{"question":"According to the text, what drives the production of more good startups from prestigious universities like MIT and Cambridge?","answer":"The difficulty of getting into these universities, which attracts smart and determined individuals.","chunk":"I don't think it's the prestigious names of these universities that cause more good startups to come out of them. Nor do I think it's because the quality of the teaching is better. What's driving this is simply the difficulty of getting in. You have to be pretty smart and determined to get into MIT or Cambridge, so if you do manage to get in, you'll find the other students include a lot of smart and determined people.","chunk_id":"b81f04934b6ca5bfd56be4f44fcaee9a"}
{"question":"What was the most common source of wealth for the 100 richest people in 1982?","answer":"Inheritance","chunk":"In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance.

Could I make them? I had no idea. I'd never imagined it was even possible. I knew intellectually that people made art â€” that it didn't just appear spontaneously â€” but it was as if the people who made it were a different species. They either lived long ago or were mysterious geniuses doing strange things in profiles in Life magazine. The idea of actually being able to make art, to put that verb before that noun, seemed almost miraculous.","chunk_id":"efbc31ba3cb1b5a46789010db880100c"}
{"question":"How did microcomputers change the computing experience?","answer":"Microcomputers changed the computing experience by allowing users to interact with a computer in real-time, responding to their keystrokes as it ran, unlike the previous method of using punch cards and waiting for processing to finish.","chunk":"With microcomputers, everything changed. Now you could have a computer sitting right in front of you, on a desk, that could respond to your keystrokes as it was running instead of just churning through a stack of punch cards and then stopping.","chunk_id":"887d701fa0e14f528a303bb96982aeb9"}

{"question":"How does the text suggest a connection between childhood experiences and adult projects?","answer":"The text suggests a connection between childhood experiences and adult projects by highlighting the knowledge that our projects as grownups are on a path that stretches back to treehouses, indicating a link between the confidence we had as kids when starting something new and our current endeavors.","chunk":"But if we couldn't benefit as kids from the knowledge that our treehouses were on the path to grownup projects, we can at least benefit as grownups from knowing that our projects are on a path that stretches back to treehouses. Remember that careless confidence you had as a kid when starting something new? That would be a powerful thing to recapture.","chunk_id":"f9933aae0c74ac83373340684c7274bb"}
{"question":"Why is Silicon Valley tolerant of failure according to the text?","answer":"Silicon Valley is tolerant of failure because people there will continue to bet on individuals who are learning from their failures, believing that personal growth from failures can lead to eventual success.","chunk":"This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should yield results eventually.","chunk_id":"61d640330dcfac2c0a786d9ee5522375"}
{"question":"How have startups evolved from the 1990s to the present according to the text?","answer":"Startups in the 1990s were primarily tech-focused companies in the electronics or software business. However, modern startups have expanded beyond tech and are now disrupting traditional industries such as retailers, TV networks, and car companies.","chunk":"The edges of the pond were pure tech: companies that actually described themselves as being in the electronics or software business. When you used the word \"startup\" in 1990, that was what you meant. But now startups are punching right through the middle of the ice crust and displacing incumbents like retailers and TV networks and car companies.","chunk_id":"d2c43c28fb444d0fc396c41c07c930cd"}
{"question":"When does the point to start worrying about extremists' actions arise, according to the text?","answer":"The point to start worrying arises when the extremists' efforts start spilling over into everyone else's lives.","chunk":"In both cases it's hard to know how much to worry. Is it really dangerous to society as a whole if a handful of extremists refuse to get their kids vaccinated, or shout down speakers at universities? The point to start worrying is presumably when their efforts start to spill over into everyone else's lives.

{"question":"What outcomes do companies with high growth rates tend to achieve, according to the text?","answer":"Companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable.","chunk":"Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.","chunk_id":"26d677b5e3cd7db5e1971408839d0b65"}
{"question":"What is the name of the startup factory co-founded by Jessica and the author mentioned in the text?","answer":"Y Combinator","chunk":"The companies at the Google end of the continuum are called startups when they're young. The reason I know about them is that my wife Jessica and I started something called Y Combinator that is basically a startup factory. Since 2005, Y Combinator has funded over 4000 startups.

You can't know whether it will turn into a company worth billions or one that goes out of business.

{"question":"How does the rise of tech companies in getting rich differ from the strategies of oil and real estate magnates and courtiers in history?","answer":"The rise of tech companies in getting rich represents a qualitative change, whereas oil and real estate magnates and courtiers in history got rich by being really driven and good at making deals.","chunk":"To that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitative change. The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400 didn't win by making better technology. They won by being really driven and good at making deals. And indeed, that way of getting rich is so old that it predates the Industrial Revolution. The courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of European royal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule, really driven and good at making deals.","chunk_id":"c1b3d1c294118794e95a8b181d6d71a6"}
{"question":"According to the text, when is the most important phase in a project of one's own?","answer":"The most important phase in a project of one's own is at the beginning, when you transition from thinking about the project to actually doing it.","chunk":"The most important phase in a project of one's own is at the beginning: when you go from thinking it might be cool to do x to actually doing x. And at that point high standards are not merely useless but positively harmful. There are a few people who start too many new projects, but far more, I suspect, who are deterred by fear of failure from starting projects that would have succeeded if they had.","chunk_id":"06842bdfb7a766bc4d43cc0cc44ef75c"}
{"question":"What is highlighted as the biggest mistake young founders make according to the text?","answer":"The biggest mistake young founders make is to build something for some mysterious group of other people.","chunk":"So it's critical, if you're a young founder, to build things for yourself and your friends to use. The biggest mistake young founders make is to build something for some mysterious group of other people. But if you can make something that you and your friends truly want to use â€” something your friends aren't just using out of loyalty to you, but would be really sad to lose if you shut it down â€” then you almost certainly have the germ of a good startup idea. It may not seem like a startup to you. It may not be obvious how to make money from it. But trust me, there's a way.","chunk_id":"1411f3d714d808f16a1f58197234c18d"}
{"question":"What are the two ingredients needed for a wave of intolerance according to the text?","answer":"The two ingredients needed for a wave of intolerance are intolerant people and an ideology to guide them.","chunk":"You need two ingredients for a wave of intolerance: intolerant people, and an ideology to guide them. The intolerant people are always there. They exist in every sufficiently large society.

{"question":"According to the text, what is one of the best ways to discover startup ideas?","answer":"Working on a project just for fun.","chunk":"One way to ensure autonomy is not to have a boss at all. There are two ways to do that: to be the boss yourself, and to work on projects outside of work. Though they're at opposite ends of the scale financially, startups and open source projects have a lot in common, including the fact that they're often run by skaters. And indeed, there's a wormhole from one end of the scale to the other: one of the best ways to discover startup ideas is to work on a project just for fun.","chunk_id":"9c8230b9e2a8a1e3a2a01b1338b490fc"}

{"question":"What does the text suggest is the critical distinction when it comes to technology and production?","answer":"The critical distinction suggested in the text is between producing or just consuming, such as writing computer games versus playing them.","chunk":"You don't have to learn programming, though. If you're wondering what counts as technology, it includes practically everything you could describe using the words \"make\" or \"build.\" So welding would count, or making clothes, or making videos. Whatever you're most interested in. The critical distinction is whether you're producing or just consuming. Are you writing computer games, or just playing them?

It emphasizes that building things you're excited about is important, even if they are games that you and your friends enjoy playing.","chunk":"Don't feel like your projects have to be serious. They can be as frivolous as you like, so long as you're building things you're excited about. Probably 90% of programmers start out building games. They and their friends like to play games. So they build the kind of things they and their friends want. And that's exactly what you should be doing at 15 if you want to start a startup one day.","chunk_id":"34d05a90a811fafb4ad85ba988d56e93"}
{"question":"How can you find cofounders for a startup according to the text?","answer":"According to the text, you can find cofounders for a startup by working on projects with them. It is recommended to find someone who is good at what they do and with whom you work well.","chunk":"Now for the third and final thing you need: a cofounder, or cofounders. The optimal startup has two or three founders, so you need one or two cofounders. How do you find them? Can you predict what I'm going to say next? It's the same thing: projects. You find cofounders by working on projects with them. What you need in a cofounder is someone who's good at what they do and that you work well with, and the only way to judge this is to work with them on things.","chunk_id":"305778c59d3ef94fa4db9f28c43f55fd"}

They found 4047 of them. How many had inherited their wealth then? Only about 20%, which is less than the proportion of heirs today.

{"question":"What is the purpose of using labels like \"x-ist\" in a discussion according to the text?","answer":"The purpose of using labels like \"x-ist\" in a discussion is to signal the end of the discussion without considering the truth of the statement.","chunk":"For example, when someone calls a statement \"x-ist,\" they're also implicitly saying that this is the end of the discussion. They do not, having said this, go on to consider whether the statement is true or not. Using such labels is the conversational equivalent of signalling an exception.

{"question":"What strategy does the text suggest for growing one's territory exponentially?","answer":"The text suggests growing one's territory exponentially through conquest.","chunk":"Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There was a way to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn't affect customs very much.

If you can find the right people, you only have to tell them what to do at the highest level. They'll handle the details. Indeed, they insist on it. For a project to feel like your own, you must have sufficient autonomy. You can't be working to order, or slowed down by bureaucracy.","chunk_id":"c934be7a88f7afb9272f779c480ae09c"}
{"question":"Why does the text suggest that systems work doesn't last long?","answer":"The text suggests that systems work doesn't last long because any program written today, no matter how good, would become obsolete in a couple of decades at best. Even good software programs would be mentioned in footnotes, but no one would actually use them, making them seem feeble.","chunk":"The problem with systems work, though, was that it didn't last. Any program you wrote today, no matter how good, would be obsolete in a couple decades at best. People might mention your software in footnotes, but no one would actually use it.

{"question":"What is the source of the step function, according to the text?","answer":"The source of the step function is not competition, but the presence of thresholds in the outcome.","chunk":"The source of the step function is not competition per se, however.

{"question":"What strategy does the text suggest to potentially discover a whole new field of knowledge?","answer":"The text suggests noticing and exploring gaps in knowledge, as one of these gaps might expand into a whole new field if lucky.","chunk":"Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in. Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your curiosity.

{"question":"Why does the text argue that the truth of a statement should not depend on who says it?","answer":"The text argues that the truth of a statement should not depend on who says it because truth should be objective and independent of the speaker.","chunk":"The clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is considered x-ist often depends on who said it. Truth doesn't work that way. The same statement can't be true when one person says it, but x-ist, and therefore false, when another person does.","chunk_id":"09dc7db69a1c13364dfbbdf340067ccf"}
{"question":"What was the author's clearest memory regarding their experience with the 1401 computer?","answer":"The author's clearest memory was the moment they learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of their programs didn't.","chunk":"I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.","chunk_id":"65c6f3ed506a3f844346e5bd8fe8962f"}
{"question":"What is the potential outcome of the switch away from institutions on the democratization of opportunity according to the text?","answer":"The resulting democratization of opportunity will be both greater and more authentic than any internal efforts by the institutions themselves.","chunk":"The switch away from institutions won't simply be an exodus of their current inhabitants.

{"question":"How can one take advantage of thresholds according to the text?","answer":"One can take advantage of thresholds by replacing something mediocre yet popular with a better alternative, as illustrated by the example of a company creating a product that people dislike yet still purchase.","chunk":"A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd buy a better alternative if you made one.","chunk_id":"b17224b10671ffad70f99617877d6240"}
{"question":"What language did the author start learning to teach himself AI?","answer":"Lisp","chunk":"There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll.

{"question":"Why does fame exhibit superlinear returns according to the text?","answer":"Fame exhibits superlinear returns because existing fans attract new ones, leading to exponential growth. Additionally, the concentration of fame is due to thresholds, as there is a limited space on the A-list in people's minds.","chunk":"Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns.

{"question":"Who has a better understanding of where money needs to be spent from restricted donations, the nonprofit or the donor?","answer":"The nonprofit usually has a better understanding of where money needs to be spent from restricted donations, as the text suggests that the donor's desired allocation may not align with the nonprofit's optimal allocation.","chunk":"Restricted donations mean donations where the donor limits what can be done with the money. This is common with big donations, perhaps the default. And yet it's usually a bad idea. Usually the way the donor wants the money spent is not the way the nonprofit would have chosen. Otherwise there would have been no need to restrict the donation.

{"question":"What distinguishes Amazon and Tesla in the tech industry, according to the text?","answer":"The commonality between Amazon and Tesla that distinguishes them in the tech industry is that Amazon started AWS and Tesla is run by someone who also has a rocket company.","chunk":"Arguably it's slightly misleading to treat tech as a category. Isn't Amazon really a retailer, and Tesla a car maker? Yes and no. Maybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, it won't seem right to put these two businesses in the same category. But at the moment at least, there is definitely something they share in common that distinguishes them. What retailer starts AWS? What car maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company?","chunk_id":"4bbad11641a122dd1dfa4c583a9d1a85"}
{"question":"Why has this antiquated-sounding religious concept come back in a secular form, and why now?","answer":"The resurgence of antiquated-sounding religious concepts in a secular form can be attributed to the cyclical nature of trends, societal shifts, and the evolution of beliefs and ideas.

{"question":"What was the primary way to work on ambitious projects fifty years ago according to the text?","answer":"Being part of an organization was the primary way to work on ambitious projects fifty years ago, as it provided resources, colleagues, and distribution.","chunk":"Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences.","chunk_id":"dd1b0f38ceb88d9dddc9f273c371ac7c"}
{"question":"Why does the author like painting still lives?","answer":"The author likes painting still lives because it allowed them to become more aware of the details and intricacies in everyday objects, which are often overlooked in daily life.","chunk":"I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or \"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.","chunk_id":"0beddcca69f84e704f5929e3e5f01a93"}

But this world has eroded significantly just in my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists and writers had in the 20th century.

{"question":"Why did the company hire more people despite not reaching breakeven until 1998?","answer":"The company hired more people due to investor pressure and industry norms during the Internet Bubble. A small team would have seemed amateurish, and reaching breakeven was delayed until about when Yahoo bought the company in the summer of 1998.","chunk":"Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that's what startups did during the Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.

You could have led a life of exemplary goodness, but if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you were going to burn. Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only get fired in the metaphorical sense, by losing their jobs. But the structure of the situation is the same: the heresy outweighs everything else.

The hard part is making this converge with the work you do as an adult. And our customs make it harder. We treat \"playing\" and \"hobbies\" as qualitatively different from \"work\".

To remain on, he had only to avoid the three unforgivable sins: crime, heresy, and marriage. The first time I read that, in the 1990s, it sounded amusingly medieval.

{"question":"Why do programmers often rewrite things that don't need rewriting and write their own versions of existing software?","answer":"Programmers often rewrite things that don't need rewriting and write their own versions of existing software because it is more rewarding and satisfying, despite the potential waste of characters. Writing code from scratch can be a creative and fulfilling experience, leading to better solutions and personal ownership of the project.","chunk":"Of course, it's easier to achieve this level of motivation when you're making something like the Macintosh. It's easy for something new to feel like a project of your own. That's one of the reasons for the tendency programmers have to rewrite things that don't need rewriting, and to write their own versions of things that already exist. This sometimes alarms managers, and measured by total number of characters typed, it's rarely the optimal solution. But it's not always driven simply by arrogance or cluelessness. Writing code from scratch is also much more rewarding â€” so much more rewarding that a good programmer can end up net ahead, despite the shocking waste of characters. Indeed, it may be one of the advantages of capitalism that it encourages such rewriting. A company that needs software to do something can't use the software already written to do it at another company, and thus has to write their own, which often turns out better.","chunk_id":"6725647917a6887e850f954eb19dac4a"}
{"question":"How does the increase in people starting more valuable companies contribute to the rise in America's Gini coefficient?","answer":"The increase in people starting more valuable companies leads to a rise in America's Gini coefficient because more individuals are generating wealth through entrepreneurship, resulting in income inequality.","chunk":"It's easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been. That means more people start them, that those who do get better terms from investors, and that the resulting companies become more valuable. Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that startups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don't have to resort to some vague right turn the country took under Reagan to explain why America's Gini coefficient is increasing. Of course the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people starting more valuable companies, how could it not be?","chunk_id":"525030549841571a2c86cfa2146cdf08"}

My hope is that this essay will help form social antibodies not just against current efforts to suppress ideas, but against the concept of heresy in general. That's the real prize.

{"question":"Why do tech companies require candidates to take a coding test before hiring them?","answer":"Tech companies require candidates to take a coding test before hiring them because grades and exam results do not necessarily indicate proficiency in programming.

We're already being taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough. You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff in classes. You can do well in computer science classes without ever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a degree in computer science from a top university and still not be any good at programming. That's why tech companies all make you take a coding test before they'll hire you, regardless of where you went to university or how well you did there.

{"question":"What are the exceptions to the principle of making unrestricted donations to nonprofits according to the text?","answer":"The exceptions mentioned in the text are umbrella organizations and donors who are experts in the domain, like the Gates Foundation.","chunk":"There are a couple exceptions to this principle. One is when the nonprofit is an umbrella organization. It's reasonable to make a restricted donation to a university, for example, because a university is only nominally a single nonprofit. Another exception is when the donor actually does know as much as the nonprofit about where money needs to be spent. The Gates Foundation, for example, has specific goals and often makes restricted donations to individual nonprofits to accomplish them.

I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time.

{"question":"How does the text explain the impact of new technology, particularly microelectronics, on J. P. Morgan's economy?","answer":"The text explains that new technology, particularly microelectronics, exerted external pressure on J. P. Morgan's economy, contributing to its breakdown. It uses the analogy of a pond with a crust of ice on top, where the weakening ice crust allows for easier penetration from the bottom to the surface.","chunk":"But it wasn't just decay from within that broke up J. P. Morgan's economy. There was also pressure from without, in the form of new technology, and particularly microelectronics. The best way to envision what happened is to imagine a pond with a crust of ice on top. Initially the only way from the bottom to the surface is around the edges. But as the ice crust weakens, you start to be able to punch right through the middle.","chunk_id":"1b742537747e90c739ad36c408871719"}
{"question":"What is one of the reasons the payoffs from startups are high, according to the text?","answer":"The natural alignment between skating and solving new problems is cited as one of the reasons the payoffs from startups are high.","chunk":"The natural alignment between skating and solving new problems is one of the reasons the payoffs from startups are so high. Not only is the market price of unsolved problems higher, you also get a discount on productivity when you work on them. In fact, you get a double increase in productivity: when you're doing a clean-sheet design, it's easier to recruit skaters, and they get to spend all their time skating.","chunk_id":"06a1d2ecf01e5715487c1db4cb89d408"}
{"question":"How does knowledge growth relate to superlinear returns according to the text?","answer":"Knowledge grows exponentially with thresholds that represent new discoveries, leading to superlinear returns. Pushing the boundaries of knowledge can lead to the discovery of new fields, granting individuals the first opportunity to make new discoveries in those areas.","chunk":"The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin.","chunk_id":"3b86e15f1e92e1df9dc1d9baba3c6ec5"}

{"question":"What did the author realize was the ultimate test of a startup based on their experience?","answer":"The author realized that the growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup, not just the absolute number of users.","chunk":"Another thing I didn't get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough, you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't hire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then you'll control your own destiny.","chunk_id":"0d23a6794aa40aa9c55fa0e17b505f13"}

Some people do this deliberately, but you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one.

This made me as happy as anything I've heard him say â€” not just because he was excited about his story, but because he'd discovered this way of working.

Kids bounce, or are herded, from one kind of work to the next, barely realizing what's happening to them. Whereas we know more about different types of work and have more control over which we do.

{"question":"Why is it only useful to believe that a company will do well in investing if most other investors don't?","answer":"It is only useful to believe that a company will do well in investing if most other investors don't because if everyone else already thinks the company will do well, its stock price will reflect that consensus, leaving no room to make money.","chunk":"This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers saying things that other people have already said. But it's just as true in investing, for example.

But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.","chunk_id":"85017506dd6b2b8bba9d373bd13bfb12"}

It had a very strong component of moral purity, and the aggressively conventional-minded seized upon it with their usual eagerness â€” all the more because the relaxation of social norms in the preceding decades meant there had been less and less to forbid.

At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because there's less competition at the far end â€” and not just for the obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well, but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few even try.

{"question":"What was the author's experience like in the painting department at art school?","answer":"The author found the painting department to be focused on self-expression rather than rigorous training, unlike departments such as textiles, illustration, and architecture which were perceived to be more rigorous.","chunk":"In the fall of 1992 I moved back to Providence to continue at RISD. The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous. Painting students were supposed to express themselves, which to the more worldly ones meant to try to cook up some sort of distinctive signature style.","chunk_id":"ad6f922259dea6ba3d58cefb97d48f58"}

I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world.

In its time, the editor was one of the best general-purpose site builders. I kept the code tight and didn't have to integrate with any other software except Robert's and Trevor's, so it was quite fun to work on.

But for my father, who was a mathematician, it wasn't. Most of us think of the problems in a math book as a way to test or develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section.

I wouldn't say exactly that you're happier. A better word would be excited, or engaged. You're happy when things are going well, but often they aren't. When I'm writing an essay, most of the time I'm worried and puzzled: worried that the essay will turn out badly, and puzzled because I'm groping for some idea that I can't see clearly enough.

Indeed, their desire to see you punished is often stronger than it would be if you'd committed an actual crime.

Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled by \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way I was converted to fatherhood once I had kids.

At first this was going to be normal desktop software, which in those days meant Windows software. That was an alarming prospect, because neither of us knew how to write Windows software or wanted to learn. We lived in the Unix world.

Choosing to do something allows for a deeper sense of ownership and dedication compared to being told to do it.","chunk":"The edge of the former is quite sharp. People who care a lot about their work are usually very sensitive to the difference between pulling, and being pushed, and work tends to fall into one category or the other. But the test isn't simply whether you're told to do something. You can choose to do something you're told to do.

{"question":"What challenges did the author face while working at Interleaf with the scripting language inspired by Emacs?","answer":"The author faced challenges in understanding the software at Interleaf because the scripting language, inspired by Lisp, was built on top of C, a language the author was unfamiliar with. Their lack of C knowledge and resistance to learning it hindered their comprehension of the software.","chunk":"Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.","chunk_id":"0405df77c94b1fb3ea9f9656a66a0ee8"}

{"question":"Why do venture capitalists prefer to invest in tech companies with better technology over others according to the text?","answer":"Venture capitalists prefer to invest in tech companies with better technology because these companies have a competitive edge and are more likely to succeed based on their technological innovations rather than just strong leadership or deal-making skills of a CEO.","chunk":"The tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form a well-differentiated group in the sense that they're all companies that venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the others mostly not. And there's a reason why: these are mostly companies that win by having better technology, rather than just a CEO who's really driven and good at making deals.","chunk_id":"f61e3e4659e8668397e3d60763cb9afc"}

{"question":"What motivated Larry and Sergey to improve search results with Google?","answer":"Larry and Sergey wanted to make search better by prioritizing search results based on importance.","chunk":"Ditto for Google. Larry and Sergey weren't trying to start a company at first. They were just trying to make search better. Before Google, most search engines didn't try to sort the results they gave you in order of importance. If you searched for \"rugby\" they just gave you every web page that contained the word \"rugby.\" And the web was so small in 1997 that this actually worked! Kind of. There might only be 20 or 30 pages with the word \"rugby,\" but the web was growing exponentially, which meant this way of doing search was becoming exponentially more broken. Most users just thought, \"Wow, I sure have to look through a lot of search results to find what I want.\" Door sticks. But like Mark, Larry and Sergey were programmers. Like Mark, they looked at this situation and thought \"Well, this is stupid. Some pages about rugby matter more than others.

I learned that it's better for technology companies to be run by product people than sales people (though sales is a real skill and people who are good at it are really good at it), that it leads to bugs when code is edited by too many people, that cheap office space is no bargain if it's depressing, that planned meetings are inferior to corridor conversations, that big, bureaucratic customers are a dangerous source of money, and that there's not much overlap between conventional office hours and the optimal time for hacking, or conventional offices and the optimal place for it.","chunk_id":"a4faaa8f5338b1e206a020fa232349d3"}

{"question":"Why is it important to excel in classes, even ones that seem less relevant, in the context of starting a successful startup like Google?","answer":"It is important to excel in classes, even those that may appear less relevant, because doing well in classes is a prerequisite for gaining entry into a good university. Attending a top university is crucial for starting a successful startup like Google, as it provides access to the best potential cofounders and employees. This is evident from Larry and Sergey's strategy of hiring smart individuals from Stanford when they started Google.","chunk":"At this point I'm going to tell you something you might not want to hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even the ones that are just memorization or blathering about literature, because you need to do well in your classes to get into a good university. And if you want to start a startup you should try to get into the best university you can, because that's where the best cofounders are. It's also where the best employees are. When Larry and Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartest people they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage for them.","chunk_id":"bd9da83d7d9b078854442d208ac2de3d"}
{"question":"Why did the author's attempt to start a company putting art galleries online fail?","answer":"The attempt failed because art galleries did not want to be online, particularly the fancy ones. They preferred traditional methods of selling and were reluctant to use online platforms.","chunk":"If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy ones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.","chunk_id":"f921aebdf04099958a917fea23cca845"}

And unfortunately schoolwork tends to be very different from working on projects of one's own. It's usually neither a project, nor one's own. So as school gets more serious, working on projects of one's own is something that survives, if at all, as a thin thread off to the side.","chunk_id":"5f1b5a420bc6c81bae4d0d57b040f0d2"}

I ran into professor Cheatham and he asked if I was far enough along to graduate that June. I didn't have a word of my dissertation written, but in what must have been the quickest bit of thinking in my life, I decided to take a shot at writing one in the 5 weeks or so that remained before the deadline, reusing parts of On Lisp where I could, and I was able to respond, with no perceptible delay \"Yes, I think so.

{"question":"How does the principle of 'do things that don't scale' apply to learning according to the text?","answer":"The principle of 'do things that don't scale' applies to learning by emphasizing the initial effort to get a toehold, leading to easier learning as you progress.","chunk":"In the startup world, the name for this principle is \"do things that don't scale.\" If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first start learning something, you feel lost. But it's worth making the initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the easier it will get.","chunk_id":"802cdee6092f048ad40c89c5d85382c9"}

{"question":"What are some fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else according to the text?","answer":"The fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else are sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing.","chunk":"What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be independent-minded to succeed â€” where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel as well.","chunk_id":"f45005c5c4cee7ea4ae0f298e8576b23"}

His roommate was away for big chunks of time, during which I got to sleep in his room. For some reason there was no bed frame or sheets, just a mattress on the floor. One morning as I was lying on this mattress I had an idea that made me sit up like a capital L. What if we ran the software on the server, and let users control it by clicking on links?

Independent-minded people I talk to seem more confident than they did a few years ago. On the other side, even some of the leaders are starting to wonder if things have gone too far.

It shades gradually into collaboration. And interestingly, it shades into collaboration in two different ways. One way to collaborate is to share a single project. For example, when two mathematicians collaborate on a proof that takes shape in the course of a conversation between them. The other way is when multiple people work on separate projects of their own that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

Additionally, in markets with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors due to exponential growth.","chunk":"It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other.

For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.

{"question":"What is the difference between painting still lifes and painting people according to the text?","answer":"The text describes the difference in approach to painting still lifes and painting people. Painting people involves modifying a generic person to match the specific individual due to their movements, while painting still lifes allows for precise replication of the subject from observation.","chunk":"While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.","chunk_id":"134ea1327b6f0be1efeb9c0d15c86020"}
{"question":"Why do founders sometimes get rich so young now according to the text?","answer":"Founders sometimes get rich so young now because the low initial cost of starting a startup allows them to start young, and the fast growth of companies today means that if they succeed, they could be surprisingly rich just a few years later.","chunk":"That's why founders sometimes get so rich so young now.

However, Trevor proved to be a frighteningly effective hacker.","chunk":"In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers, and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him.

{"question":"How can we predict when a research problem is not likely to lead to new discoveries according to the text?","answer":"We can predict when a research problem is not likely to lead to new discoveries when it seems legit but boring, as opposed to problems that lead to new discoveries which tend to seem very mystifying but possibly unimportant.","chunk":"It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research problem isn't likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism â€” to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what you're supposed to.","chunk_id":"cb936b553f33af9b313db30bd9e2fce7"}

It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low.

{"question":"What was the prestigious route for individuals in 1960, according to the text?","answer":"In 1960, the prestigious route for individuals was to work their way up the corporate ladder at an existing company, rather than starting their own company.","chunk":"In 1960, most of the people who start startups today would have gone to work for one of them. You could get rich from starting your own company in 1890 and in 2020, but in 1960 it was not really a viable option. You couldn't break through the oligopolies to get at the markets. So the prestigious route in 1960 was not to start your own company, but to work your way up the corporate ladder at an existing one.","chunk_id":"0b82b4e0e856773bd7578e096d04f7c0"}
{"question":"What misconception does the text address regarding returns in business?","answer":"The text addresses the misconception that returns in business are linear, as commonly told by teachers and coaches.","chunk":"Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. \"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" They meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business.","chunk_id":"a9e8cdfb42e07e3fafbce6b69e79ed53"}
{"question":"How does fast growth impact the value of founders' stock according to the text?","answer":"Fast growth increases the value of founders' stock by reaching a billion dollars in revenue sooner and making the company more valuable compared to slower growth.","chunk":"Fast growth has a double effect on the value of founders' stock. The value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growth rate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billion dollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when it reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower.","chunk_id":"87ee9b18ef36b2574965b698c3bb67cc"}
{"question":"How did Steve Jobs' study of calligraphy as a teenager benefit Apple's computer business?","answer":"Steve Jobs' study of calligraphy helped him understand graphic design, which gave Apple a competitive advantage in the computer business, especially with the release of the Macintosh.","chunk":"Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, spent time when he was a teenager studying calligraphy â€” the sort of beautiful writing that you see in medieval manuscripts. No one, including him, thought that this would help him in his career. He was just doing it because he was interested in it. But it turned out to help him a lot. The computer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out at just the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letters like the ones in printed books instead of the computery-looking letters you see in 8 bit games. Apple destroyed everyone else at this, and one reason was that Steve was one of the few people in the computer business who really got graphic design.","chunk_id":"980edb7442a1c0b4847d9c01d2d087a6"}
{"question":"Why did Viaweb set their prices so low for their ecommerce software?","answer":"Viaweb set their prices low for their ecommerce software because the founders were not familiar with what businesses paid for such services. They charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one, without any clever insight about pricing in the industry.","chunk":"There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low. We had no idea what businesses paid for things. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us.","chunk_id":"ecb54f5e07af0882bf7110b830402fd3"}
{"question":"What is emphasized as crucial for doing something exceptionally well according to the text?","answer":"Interest in the subject","chunk":"There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right. For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're interested in, and to find ways to work on it. It will also be important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example, if there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when you're young and don't yet have children.","chunk_id":"b7d724db10611c1c1d3998a68149ded2"}

When I came back to visit for a project later on, someone told me about a new thing called HTML, which was, as he described it, a derivative of SGML.

This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages. RISD counted me as a transfer sophomore and said I had to do the foundation that summer.

You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.","chunk_id":"4488c0b3bc69d52dfae583105d7cbc1f"}

This highlights the significance of catering to the low end of the market to avoid being surpassed by competitors.","chunk":"But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling.

{"question":"What was the arrangement between the students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia as described in the text?","answer":"The arrangement was that the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return, the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything.

Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me.

{"question":"Why is it important to put in initial effort and take extraordinary measures in fields with superlinear returns?","answer":"It is important to put in initial effort and take extraordinary measures in fields with superlinear returns because although the returns may seem small at first, the reward curve rises steeply at the far end, making it worth the effort and measures taken.","chunk":"What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at first. At this rate, you find yourself thinking, I'll never get anywhere. But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far end, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.","chunk_id":"224beaf94ff8e8b8963a5fe112c87742"}
{"question":"Why do donors often make restricted donations, despite the fact that they may do less good than unrestricted ones?","answer":"Donors often make restricted donations due to motives beyond just doing good, such as making a mark, generating publicity, complying with regulations, or following corporate policies. Some donors may not be aware of the distinction between restricted and unrestricted donations, and nonprofits may not actively discourage this lack of awareness.","chunk":"If restricted donations do less good than unrestricted ones, why do donors so often make them? Partly because doing good isn't donors' only motive. They often have other motives as well â€” to make a mark, or to generate good publicity, or to comply with regulations or corporate policies. Many donors may simply never have considered the distinction between restricted and unrestricted donations. They may believe that donating money for some specific purpose is just how donation works. And to be fair, nonprofits don't try very hard to discourage such illusions. They can't afford to. People running nonprofits are almost always anxious about money. They can't afford to talk back to big donors.","chunk_id":"7deb11c176b3d25a382184627006f73a"}
{"question":"What concept does the author criticize in the text regarding work and life balance?","answer":"The author criticizes the concept of 'work/life balance' and argues that it may not be suitable for individuals who are passionate about their work on projects they find exciting.","chunk":"In Andy Hertzfeld's book on the Macintosh, he describes how they'd come back into the office after dinner and work late into the night. People who've never experienced the thrill of working on a project they're excited about can't distinguish this kind of working long hours from the kind that happens in sweatshops and boiler rooms, but they're at opposite ends of the spectrum. That's why it's a mistake to insist dogmatically on \"work/life balance.\" Indeed, the mere expression \"work/life\" embodies a mistake: it assumes work and life are distinct. For those to whom the word \"work\" automatically implies the dutiful plodding kind, they are. But for the skaters, the relationship between work and life would be better represented by a dash than a slash. I wouldn't want to work on anything that I didn't want to take over my life.","chunk_id":"1f14fe7533c5085e6723c26ccce1e349"}
{"question":"Why does the author avoid mentioning specific heresies in the essay?","answer":"The author avoids mentioning specific heresies in the essay because they want it to remain relevant in the future, as there will always be conventionally minded individuals looking to censor ideas, and they just need an ideology to guide them in what to censor, with the current one being unlikely to be the last.","chunk":"And that's the second reason I've avoided mentioning any specific heresies. I want this essay to work in the future, not just now. And unfortunately it probably will. The aggressively conventional-minded will always be among us, looking for things to forbid.

{"question":"What is a signature style in the context of art, and how does it relate to the value of artwork?","answer":"A signature style in art is the visual equivalent of a 'schtick,' serving as a unique identifier for an artist's work. It is something that immediately distinguishes the work as belonging to a specific artist. The presence of a signature style can increase the value of artwork in the market, with buyers willing to pay more for pieces that exhibit such a distinctive style.","chunk":"A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein. So if you see a big painting of this type hanging in the apartment of a hedge fund manager, you know he paid millions of dollars for it. That's not always why artists have a signature style, but it's usually why buyers pay a lot for such work.","chunk_id":"82ee932303c77a9fed50e2abfd49e321"}
{"question":"Is it preferable for the richest people to get rich by starting tech companies compared to wealth acquisition methods from inheritance, natural resources extraction, or real estate deals?","answer":"The question raises the debatable point of whether it is better for the wealthiest individuals to accumulate wealth by founding tech companies, as opposed to methods like inheritance, natural resource extraction, and real estate deals, which were prevalent in 1982.","chunk":"People who don't look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn't get as rich. But if you dig into how they got rich, the old days don't look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals.

{"question":"Can a statement be x-ist and true at the same time?","answer":"If a statement can be x-ist and true at the same time, it implies that truth is being banned.

Can a statement be x-ist, for whatever value of x, and also true? If the answer is yes, then they're admitting to banning the truth. That's obvious enough that I'd guess most would answer no.

{"question":"Why are heuristics like 'seek thresholds' and 'seek competition' considered trickier in the context of step functions and exponential growth?","answer":"Heuristics like 'seek thresholds' and 'seek competition' are considered trickier in the context of step functions and exponential growth because the existence of a threshold or competition doesn't guarantee that the game will be worth playing. For example, playing Russian roulette involves a threshold but does not necessarily lead to a better outcome. Similarly, seeking competition may not be useful if the prize is not worth competing for. Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees the shape and magnitude of the return curve, but thresholds only ensure the shape.","chunk":"What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the form \"seek thresholds\" or \"seek competition?\" Here the situation is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette, you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the best case you're no better off. \"Seek competition\" is similarly useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve â€” because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it's trivially small at first â€” but thresholds only guarantee the shape.","chunk_id":"db822496ffae6ad17a6e0f0307aa55da"}
{"question":"What does the text suggest about the concept of work and a job?","answer":"The text suggests that work should not be equated with a job, especially for individuals in creative professions like writers, artists, and scientists. Unlike the traditional belief that work is tied to a job, for them, work is defined by what they are studying or creating, which they carry with them regardless of employment status.","chunk":"There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the 20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job. Even now to most people the phrase \"your work\" means their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all.

{"question":"Why did the big companies break up by 1970 according to the text?","answer":"The big companies broke up by 1970 partly due to senescence, as they transitioned from models of scale and efficiency to being slack and bloated.

Partly senescence. The big companies that seemed models of scale and efficiency in 1930 had by 1970 become slack and bloated. By 1970 the rigid structure of the economy was full of cosy nests that various groups had built to insulate themselves from market forces.
