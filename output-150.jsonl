{"question":"What outcomes do companies with high growth rates tend to achieve according to the text?","answer":"Companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable.","chunk":"Startups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.","chunk_id":"26d677b5e3cd7db5e1971408839d0b65"}
{"question":"According to the text, where do founders often find their cofounders and ideas for startups?","answer":"Founders often find their cofounders and ideas for startups at universities.","chunk":"You don't have to start a startup with someone you meet at university. The founders of Twitch met when they were seven. The founders of Stripe, Patrick and John Collison, met when John was born. But universities are the main source of cofounders. And because they're where the cofounders are, they're also where the ideas are, because the best ideas grow out of projects you do with the people who become your cofounders.","chunk_id":"708d5f638252ac76efe52388ffb7df2e"}

{"question":"According to the text, what should your projects be?","answer":"Your projects should be whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious.","chunk":"What should your projects be? Whatever seems to you excitingly ambitious. As you grow older and your taste in projects evolves, exciting and important will converge.

{"question":"According to the text, what should ambitious people focus on when it comes to the third criterion?","answer":"Ambitious people should focus on finding something they have an aptitude for and great interest in.","chunk":"In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in.","chunk_id":"86395062c7f7fe8f9f3b3433b031c06a"}
{"question":"What are the three qualities that the work you choose should have, according to the text?","answer":"A natural aptitude, a deep interest, and the opportunity to do great work.","chunk":"The first step is to decide what to work on.

{"question":"According to the text, what does having strange tastes in interestingness often indicate?","answer":"Having strange tastes in interestingness often indicates strong tastes, which can lead to productivity.","chunk":"Don't worry if you find you're interested in different things than other people. The stranger your tastes in interestingness, the better. Strange tastes are often strong ones, and a strong taste for work means you'll be productive.

{"question":"According to the text, why can't you discover natural selection through planning?","answer":"Natural selection cannot be discovered through planning because it is not an achievement that can be described in advance.","chunk":"The trouble with planning is that it only works for achievements you can describe in advance. You can win a gold medal or get rich by deciding to as a child and then tenaciously pursuing that goal, but you can't discover natural selection that way.","chunk_id":"b69aabf2e030b9e2f0ce8797ac93467c"}
{"question":"Why does Y Combinator encourage founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers?","answer":"Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers to prevent early discouragement, aid in decision-making, and achieve exponential growth.","chunk":"Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially.","chunk_id":"1a7ffb66eee2c0776a951b980216c488"}
{"question":"How can you find a cofounder for a startup according to the text?","answer":"You can find a cofounder for a startup by working on projects with them.","chunk":"Now for the third and final thing you need: a cofounder, or cofounders. The optimal startup has two or three founders, so you need one or two cofounders. How do you find them? Can you predict what I'm going to say next? It's the same thing: projects. You find cofounders by working on projects with them. What you need in a cofounder is someone who's good at what they do and that you work well with, and the only way to judge this is to work with them on things.","chunk_id":"305778c59d3ef94fa4db9f28c43f55fd"}
{"question":"What is an example of a case where superlinear returns are apparent according to the text?","answer":"An example of superlinear returns is when working on something that grows exponentially, like bacterial cultures.","chunk":"The most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great.","chunk_id":"03c9013702d3b30ffe3d48073bf40d99"}
{"question":"What is the main criticism of educational systems in the text?","answer":"The main criticism of educational systems in the text is that they expect students to commit to a field early without knowing what it's really like, causing ambitious individuals to be perceived as instances of breakage.","chunk":"The educational systems in most countries pretend it's easy. They expect you to commit to a field long before you could know what it's really like. And as a result an ambitious person on an optimal trajectory will often read to the system as an instance of breakage.","chunk_id":"914b25fca4245befec89bd94d6996d01"}
{"question":"What is an example provided in the text to explain the concept of compounding work?","answer":"Learning and growing an audience are examples provided in the text to explain the concept of compounding work.","chunk":"If you do work that compounds, you'll get exponential growth. Most people who do this do it unconsciously, but it's worth stopping to think about. Learning, for example, is an instance of this phenomenon: the more you learn about something, the easier it is to learn more. Growing an audience is another: the more fans you have, the more new fans they'll bring you.","chunk_id":"155e7ff0b281e9df22480fea1989775a"}
{"question":"What challenges are highlighted in the text when working on exciting projects?","answer":"The challenges of working on exciting projects include the inconsistency of motivation, with both moments of inspiration driving action and times when progress is not as smooth.","chunk":"Even when you've found something exciting to work on, working on it is not always straightforward. There will be times when some new idea makes you leap out of bed in the morning and get straight to work.

{"question":"What is the key point made regarding writing an exciting story according to the text?","answer":"The key point is that the most exciting story to write is the one you want to read, not what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants.","chunk":"This should follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. The reason I mention this case explicitly is that so many people get it wrong. Instead of making what they want, they try to make what some imaginary, more sophisticated audience wants. And once you go down that route, you're lost.","chunk_id":"38a87df5fbcae92b689ff32539a0da0f"}

{"question":"What concept does the text challenge regarding returns?","answer":"The text challenges the concept of linear returns, where you get out what you put in, stating that it is rarely true in reality.","chunk":"Teachers and coaches implicitly told us the returns were linear. \"You get out,\" I heard a thousand times, \"what you put in.\" They meant well, but this is rarely true. If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business.","chunk_id":"a9e8cdfb42e07e3fafbce6b69e79ed53"}

{"question":"According to the text, why is it essential to work on something you're deeply interested in?","answer":"Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could.","chunk":"Steps two and four will require hard work. It may not be possible to prove that you have to work hard to do great things, but the empirical evidence is on the scale of the evidence for mortality. That's why it's essential to work on something you're deeply interested in. Interest will drive you to work harder than mere diligence ever could.","chunk_id":"bb8ad167b0f03e72e5f864d7b6a356cc"}
{"question":"What example is provided in the text to illustrate the limitation of exponential growth in herding?","answer":"The example of herding is provided, where grazing land was the limiting factor for exponential growth.","chunk":"What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially.","chunk_id":"df602c06b072a9ee919034b1903bad01"}
{"question":"What is the key to achieving great things according to the text?","answer":"The key to achieving great things according to the text is consistency.","chunk":"The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.","chunk_id":"e846c60a3dfb9cee5528a6c91cd9ca1c"}
{"question":"What strategy does the text suggest for growing one's territory exponentially?","answer":"The text suggests that growing one's territory exponentially can be achieved through conquest.","chunk":"Or more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There was a way to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use in one's own life.","chunk_id":"83fe7dd856a75e38a461563e6c71b5ab"}
{"question":"Why do people underrate exponential growth in its early stages, according to the text?","answer":"People underrate exponential growth in its early stages because the curve feels flat in the beginning, making it difficult to intuitively grasp the exponential curve.","chunk":"The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn't; it's still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can't grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages.","chunk_id":"51dd133cf4e21475ec936ed8264edf52"}
{"question":"According to the text, what distinguishes someone involved in technology from someone who is not?","answer":"The critical distinction is whether the person is producing or just consuming content.","chunk":"You don't have to learn programming, though. If you're wondering what counts as technology, it includes practically everything you could describe using the words \"make\" or \"build.\" So welding would count, or making clothes, or making videos.

That's the cutoff.","chunk_id":"7158d40157d16f1c2c96f0d7fe8104f4"}
{"question":"Why is per-project procrastination considered more dangerous than per-day procrastination according to the text?","answer":"Per-project procrastination is considered more dangerous because it involves putting off starting ambitious projects for long periods, leading to significant delays in completing important tasks.","chunk":"Since there are two senses of starting work — per day and per project — there are also two forms of procrastination. Per-project procrastination is far the more dangerous. You put off starting that ambitious project from year to year because the time isn't quite right. When you're procrastinating in units of years, you can get a lot not done.","chunk_id":"8d28709725ba62b70e473ad6e359dc28"}
{"question":"What factor plays a significant role in success when working independently according to the text?","answer":"Luck is a significant factor in success, especially when working independently, according to the text.","chunk":"And there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component of true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking risks early.","chunk_id":"c6e3dba2cc1f38b704ec6437eec9fb23"}
{"question":"What was the most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times according to the text?","answer":"Scholarship","chunk":"The most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain topics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect.","chunk_id":"7a4ce1b65d7b83161dc40313b80ad9e2"}
{"question":"According to the text, why do the best startups often grow out of projects that were not meant to be startups?","answer":"The best startups often grow out of projects that were not meant to be startups because founders are following their instincts about what's interesting rather than intentionally trying to start a company.","chunk":"It's obvious in retrospect that this was a great idea for a startup. It wasn't obvious at the time. It's never obvious. If it was obviously a good idea to start Apple or Google or Facebook, someone else would have already done it. That's why the best startups grow out of projects that aren't meant to be startups. You're not trying to start a company. You're just following your instincts about what's interesting. And if you're young and good at technology, then your unconscious instincts about what's interesting are better than your conscious ideas about what would be a good company.","chunk_id":"67cc7dca1c73fd07fc61ef1bca564baf"}

But I was also curious about the shape of the intersection. And one thing this exercise shows is that it does have a definite shape; it's not just a point labelled \"work hard.\"","chunk_id":"93f3ad456dea10a47e2b50cb182a58f7"}
{"question":"What is the relationship between growth rate, performance, and rewards over time according to the text?","answer":"If growth rate were proportional to performance, the reward for performance p over time t would be proportional to pt.","chunk":"YC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate \"you get out what you put in,\" but it's not far from the truth.

{"question":"According to the text, what quality is often present in great work?","answer":"A tincture of strangeness","chunk":"If the answers seem strange, so much the better. Great work often has a tincture of strangeness. You see this from painting to math.

{"question":"What are the essential steps to take in order to start a startup according to the text?","answer":"The essential steps to start a startup according to the text are getting good at technology by working on personal projects and excelling in school to gain admission to a good university where potential cofounders and ideas can be found.","chunk":"So the list of what you need to do to get from here to starting a startup is quite short. You need to get good at technology, and the way to do that is to work on your own projects.

{"question":"Why is it important to do well in classes to get into a good university for aspiring startup founders?","answer":"It is important to do well in classes to get into a good university for aspiring startup founders because good universities attract the best cofounders and employees, as demonstrated by Larry and Sergey hiring smart people from Stanford when they started Google.","chunk":"At this point I'm going to tell you something you might not want to hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even the ones that are just memorization or blathering about literature, because you need to do well in your classes to get into a good university. And if you want to start a startup you should try to get into the best university you can, because that's where the best cofounders are. It's also where the best employees are. When Larry and Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartest people they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage for them.","chunk_id":"bd9da83d7d9b078854442d208ac2de3d"}
{"question":"What caution does the text offer regarding learning and overoptimization?","answer":"The text cautions against overoptimizing what you're learning and advises against limiting yourself to only known valuable things, as you may not yet know what will be valuable in the future.","chunk":"But don't overoptimize what you're learning. Don't limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.","chunk_id":"4488c0b3bc69d52dfae583105d7cbc1f"}
{"question":"What are the consequences of working too hard according to the text?","answer":"According to the text, working too hard can lead to diminishing returns, fatigue, reduced productivity, and potential health damage.","chunk":"For example, while you must work hard, it's possible to work too hard, and if you do that you'll find you get diminishing returns: fatigue will make you stupid, and eventually even damage your health. The point at which work yields diminishing returns depends on the type. Some of the hardest types you might only be able to do for four or five hours a day.","chunk_id":"602cd612876dc1806aa252db3950a116"}
{"question":"How can you naturally end up in a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else, according to the text?","answer":"If you have sufficient natural ability and follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in such a field.","chunk":"It's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately, but you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one. Your curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns if they're not already part of one.","chunk_id":"d0a54081bf8080dcaab13a9347e6ab3c"}
{"question":"What heuristic is suggested in the text to achieve superlinear returns?","answer":"The heuristic suggested in the text to achieve superlinear returns is 'always be learning'.","chunk":"Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.","chunk_id":"1da26f4497b8e6a39455251021c98d61"}
{"question":"What heuristic does the text provide for finding work with superlinear returns?","answer":"The text suggests that a heuristic for finding work with superlinear returns is to look for fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else, indicating a correlation between superlinear returns and inequality.","chunk":"In fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.","chunk_id":"0508b55d554da6a989ea75bd2a8f912d"}
{"question":"How can you expand your concept of programming according to the text?","answer":"You can expand your concept of programming by learning weird languages that most programmers consider weird but are used by smart individuals. Focus on the differences between the weird language and popular languages to discover what can be uniquely expressed in the weird language.","chunk":"So if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be, one way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart, and then focus on the differences between this language and the intersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the process of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say, you'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't previously think.","chunk_id":"4e6e14e4247ca62a823725b99bcffae6"}

{"question":"What suggestion would a carpenter likely have upon seeing the sign warning about the hard-to-close door in the shop?","answer":"A carpenter would likely suggest planing off the part of the door that sticks.","chunk":"In the town near our house there's a shop with a sign warning that the door is hard to close. The sign has been there for several years. To the people in the shop it must seem like this mysterious natural phenomenon that the door sticks, and all they can do is put up a sign warning customers about it.

{"question":"What mindset is crucial for doing great work according to the text?","answer":"Viewing the work as sufficiently engaging rather than a cost while spending a considerable amount of time on a problem.","chunk":"Great work usually entails spending what would seem to most people an unreasonable amount of time on a problem. You can't think of this time as a cost, or it will seem too high. You have to find the work sufficiently engaging as it's happening.","chunk_id":"3a61a6e80d33d38fd774f634554d2749"}

{"question":"Why is it important to be interested in the work you do according to the text?","answer":"It is important to be interested in the work you do because mere diligence is not enough to do something exceptionally well, especially in a world with superlinear returns.","chunk":"There are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right. For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're interested in, and to find ways to work on it. It will also be important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example, if there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when you're young and don't yet have children.","chunk_id":"b7d724db10611c1c1d3998a68149ded2"}

What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.","chunk_id":"44b1f682be6d29b399b2947a426137e8"}
{"question":"What does the text suggest about getting startup ideas once you are good at technology?","answer":"The text suggests that once you are good at technology, you can identify missing elements in the technology and broken things that could be improved, leading to potential startup ideas.","chunk":"Actually it's easy to get startup ideas once you're good at technology. Once you're good at some technology, when you look at the world you see dotted outlines around the things that are missing. You start to be able to see both the things that are missing from the technology itself, and all the broken things that could be fixed using it, and each one of these is a potential startup.","chunk_id":"64135aeb363911fea8510bbea00a38fe"}
{"question":"What principle is mentioned in the startup world to kick off exponential growth?","answer":"The principle mentioned in the startup world to kick off exponential growth is 'do things that don't scale.'","chunk":"In the startup world, the name for this principle is \"do things that don't scale.\" If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first start learning something, you feel lost.

{"question":"Why does the text recommend finishing what you start, even if it seems more challenging than expected?","answer":"The text recommends finishing what you start because in many projects, a lot of the best work happens in what was intended to be the final stage.","chunk":"Try to finish what you start, though, even if it turns out to be more work than you expected. Finishing things is not just an exercise in tidiness or self-discipline.

{"question":"How did Apple transition from a project to a company?","answer":"Apple transitioned from a project to a company when Steve Jobs proposed the idea of selling plans for the computer that Steve Wozniak had built, turning it into a commercial venture.","chunk":"Facebook was not unusual in this respect. Apple and Google also began as projects. Apple wasn't meant to be a company. Steve Wozniak just wanted to build his own computer. It only turned into a company when Steve Jobs said \"Hey, I wonder if we could sell plans for this computer to other people.\" That's how Apple started.

{"question":"How can undirected thinking during activities like walking, showering, or lying in bed help solve problems according to the text?","answer":"Undirected thinking during activities like walking, showering, or lying in bed can be powerful in solving problems that frontal attack approaches couldn't solve.","chunk":"Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.","chunk_id":"bf8bc23326de3cc8c8e109f78161feff"}
{"question":"What examples of thresholds in learning are provided in the text?","answer":"The examples of thresholds in learning provided in the text are learning to ride a bicycle and learning to read.","chunk":"The most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns may be learning. Knowledge grows exponentially, but there are also thresholds in it. Learning to ride a bicycle, for example. Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin.","chunk_id":"3b86e15f1e92e1df9dc1d9baba3c6ec5"}
{"question":"What is the impact of the shift away from institutions on the democratization of opportunity according to the text?","answer":"The shift away from institutions will lead to a democratization of opportunity that is greater and more authentic, with new winners being individuals who were previously not accepted by these institutions.","chunk":"The switch away from institutions won't simply be an exodus of their current inhabitants. Many of the new winners will be people they'd never have let in. So the resulting democratization of opportunity will be both greater and more authentic than any tame intramural version the institutions themselves might have cooked up.","chunk_id":"1a5a45467c512031a1fa826f099763b8"}
{"question":"What is the next step suggested in the text after finding something you're excessively interested in?","answer":"The next step suggested in the text is to learn enough about it to reach one of the frontiers of knowledge.","chunk":"Once you've found something you're excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.","chunk_id":"4e4a28cb7d264c691e8f4b86fbf9e51d"}
{"question":"What is the comparison made in the text between doing great work and sailing?","answer":"The comparison is between the process of doing great work and sailing, highlighting the importance of technique in both activities.","chunk":"You don't just put out your sail and get blown forward by inspiration.

{"question":"What should one optimize for when in doubt according to the text?","answer":"Optimize for interestingness.","chunk":"When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they're like. But a field should become increasingly interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you.","chunk_id":"21bf4d90d6fcba83bd8dff5ddd03b161"}
{"question":"According to the text, what heuristic can be used to identify research problems that are likely to lead to new discoveries?","answer":"One heuristic discussed in the text is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism, giving free rein to curiosity instead of adhering to societal expectations or norms.","chunk":"It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research problem isn't likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism — to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what you're supposed to.","chunk_id":"cb936b553f33af9b313db30bd9e2fce7"}
{"question":"What is the role of curiosity in the territory of superlinear returns according to the text?","answer":"Curiosity may be more powerful than ambition in the territory of superlinear returns, as it can lead to exploring interesting questions and potentially turning them into mountains of growth.","chunk":"The territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed, the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.","chunk_id":"ac467b98b11b5e5e4e07b50029e90fe0"}
{"question":"Why is Silicon Valley so tolerant of failure according to the text?","answer":"Silicon Valley is tolerant of failure because people there believe in betting on individuals who learn from their failures and value personal growth.","chunk":"This is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should yield results eventually.","chunk_id":"61d640330dcfac2c0a786d9ee5522375"}

{"question":"Why does the text recommend getting good at programming if unsure about which technology to focus on?","answer":"The text recommends getting good at programming because it has been the source of the median startup for the last 30 years and is likely to remain crucial in the future, making it a valuable skill in the tech industry.","chunk":"If you're not sure what technology to get good at, get good at programming. That has been the source of the median startup for the last 30 years, and this is probably not going to change in the next 10.","chunk_id":"8501afc7dc4205533b048c117662c89a"}
{"question":"According to the text, what is the recipe for doing great work?","answer":"The recipe for doing great work is to work hard on excitingly ambitious projects and something good will come of it, without the need for much planning.","chunk":"But while you need boldness, you don't usually need much planning. In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants.","chunk_id":"4367ec7890eac9d1bbc5c1dca5b308c6"}
{"question":"What does the text suggest about superlinear returns for performance in business and other areas of life?","answer":"The text suggests that superlinear returns for performance in business and other areas of life are a feature of the world, not a result of rules we have created, and that the rich tend to get richer in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and benefit to humanity.","chunk":"It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer.","chunk_id":"7328e00298d2c1298c2e73bc1bf27c65"}
{"question":"What is an example of a programming technique that goes beyond glue programming, as described in the text?","answer":"Lisp macros","chunk":"A concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers. They're not only not in the intersection of popular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go beyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by first writing a language for problems of that type, and then writing your specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do with macros; it's just one region in a space of program-manipulating techniques that even now is far from fully explored.","chunk_id":"5280a9384a8c53079d56c176ec3c8202"}

{"question":"What is the advice given in the text for getting good at technology and choosing which technology to focus on?","answer":"The advice given in the text is to work on your own projects and focus on whatever interests you the most, rather than trying to predict the most valuable technology.","chunk":"How do you get good at technology? And how do you choose which technology to get good at? Both of those questions turn out to have the same answer: work on your own projects. Don't try to guess whether gene editing or LLMs or rockets will turn out to be the most valuable technology to know about. No one can predict that. Just work on whatever interests you the most.

{"question":"Why is per-project procrastination considered dangerous according to the text?","answer":"Per-project procrastination is dangerous because it can masquerade as actual work, making individuals believe they are being productive when they are actually procrastinating on important tasks.","chunk":"One reason per-project procrastination is so dangerous is that it usually camouflages itself as work. You're not just sitting around doing nothing; you're working industriously on something else. So per-project procrastination doesn't set off the alarms that per-day procrastination does. You're too busy to notice it.","chunk_id":"daa2a396700bdcb06bf7cae5f59de652"}
{"question":"How can one take advantage of superlinear returns for performance according to the text?","answer":"One can take advantage of superlinear returns for performance by doing exceptionally good work, which is a bargain due to less competition at the far end of the curve and the intimidation factor that deters many from attempting exceptional work.","chunk":"The most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because there's less competition at the far end — and not just for the obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well, but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few even try. Which means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional work, but a bargain even to try to.","chunk_id":"015cef6e0866be07f6e0e95e52218879"}
{"question":"Why is it beneficial to learn about multiple things rather than just focusing on one project according to the text?","answer":"Learning about multiple things allows for a broader range of knowledge and skills, leading to greater personal growth and potential success. Steve Jobs is cited as an example of someone who valued learning about various subjects, such as calligraphy and electronics, which enhanced his abilities and contributions.","chunk":"You don't have to do just one project. In fact it's good to learn about multiple things. Steve Jobs didn't just learn calligraphy. He also learned about electronics, which was even more valuable. Whatever you're interested in.

{"question":"What are the two forms of ambition discussed in the text, and how do they relate to doing great work?","answer":"The two forms of ambition discussed in the text are one that precedes interest in a subject and one that grows out of it. Individuals who do great work often have a mix of these two forms of ambition, with the more dominant form influencing decision-making on what to do.","chunk":"The nature of ambition exacerbates this problem. Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do.","chunk_id":"38cb4a726464b3ff90619c152958667a"}

{"question":"How does the text suggest taking advantage of thresholds in the context of popular but mediocre products?","answer":"The text suggests that if a company produces a product that people dislike but still purchase, it could be beneficial to replace it with a better alternative.","chunk":"A principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd buy a better alternative if you made one.","chunk_id":"b17224b10671ffad70f99617877d6240"}
{"question":"How does work compound indirectly according to the text?","answer":"Work compounds indirectly by teaching you, leading to exponential growth through learning even if immediate goals are not achieved.","chunk":"There are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless.","chunk_id":"297e3ccff3010cafe2293d3fc7e480b0"}
{"question":"What story about exponential growth is mentioned in the text?","answer":"The story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice on the first day and double the amount each successive day.","chunk":"Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll get exponential growth.

{"question":"Why is it emphasized in the text that students need to work on personal projects in addition to learning in classes?","answer":"The text emphasizes working on personal projects because simply learning in classes may not be enough to develop programming skills. Grades and exam results do not necessarily reflect programming ability.","chunk":"Those of you who are taking computer science classes in school may at this point be thinking, ok, we've got this sorted. We're already being taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough. You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff in classes. You can do well in computer science classes without ever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a degree in computer science from a top university and still not be any good at programming. That's why tech companies all make you take a coding test before they'll hire you, regardless of where you went to university or how well you did there.

{"question":"What are some fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else according to the text?","answer":"According to the text, some fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else include sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing.","chunk":"What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be independent-minded to succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel as well.","chunk_id":"f45005c5c4cee7ea4ae0f298e8576b23"}
{"question":"What are the implications of superlinear returns for performance in the context of societal and technological advancements?","answer":"Superlinear returns for performance imply that as activities scale up, the output or returns increase at a rate faster than linear. This concept has profound implications for societal and technological advancements as it can lead to exponential growth, disproportionate rewards for a few individuals or companies, and significant disruptions in various industries.","chunk":"There's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change has been dramatic by historical standards.

{"question":"How does fame demonstrate the concept of superlinear returns according to the text?","answer":"Fame is cited as an example of superlinear returns because it grows exponentially as existing fans attract new ones. Additionally, the concentration of fame is attributed to thresholds, as there is a limited space on the A-list in the average person's mind.","chunk":"Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because existing fans bring you new ones.

{"question":"What is the main reason it's challenging to figure out what to work on, according to the text?","answer":"The main reason it's hard to determine what to work on is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like without actually doing them, leading to incomplete information.","chunk":"Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work.

{"question":"Why do people often undervalue exponential growth according to the text?","answer":"People often undervalue exponential growth because they underestimate its value early on and do not consciously realize they could invest in it for extraordinary results. The text suggests that the initial challenges of learning new things or building an audience lead people to unconsciously push through, rather than intentionally investing in exponential growth.","chunk":"Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it's worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it.","chunk_id":"67a2b26d8d49fd4a9035a06520a05dd2"}

{"question":"How did Steve Jobs' interest in calligraphy influence the success of the Macintosh computer?","answer":"Steve Jobs' interest in calligraphy influenced the success of the Macintosh computer by shaping his appreciation for beautiful writing and graphic design, which played a crucial role in making the computer stand out with high-quality typography and design.","chunk":"Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, spent time when he was a teenager studying calligraphy — the sort of beautiful writing that you see in medieval manuscripts. No one, including him, thought that this would help him in his career. He was just doing it because he was interested in it. But it turned out to help him a lot. The computer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out at just the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letters like the ones in printed books instead of the computery-looking letters you see in 8 bit games. Apple destroyed everyone else at this, and one reason was that Steve was one of the few people in the computer business who really got graphic design.","chunk_id":"980edb7442a1c0b4847d9c01d2d087a6"}

{"question":"According to the text, what does the phrase 'your work' typically mean to most people?","answer":"To most people, the phrase 'your work' typically means their job.","chunk":"There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the 20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job. Even now to most people the phrase \"your work\" means their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all.

{"question":"What is the significance of putting in initial effort in fields with superlinear returns according to the text?","answer":"The significance of putting in initial effort in fields with superlinear returns is that although the returns may seem small at first, the reward curve rises steeply at the far end, making it worth taking extraordinary measures to achieve success.","chunk":"What else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at first. At this rate, you find yourself thinking, I'll never get anywhere.

{"question":"Why is it often challenging to know what kind of work to pursue when young?","answer":"It is often difficult to know what kind of work to pursue when young because individuals may not be aware of their strengths or the existence of certain types of work. While some may have a clear career path early on, most people have to discover their interests and talents gradually.","chunk":"That sounds straightforward, but it's often quite difficult. When you're young you don't know what you're good at or what different kinds of work are like. Some kinds of work you end up doing may not even exist yet.

It suggests that creating something that friends genuinely want to use can be the basis of a successful startup idea.","chunk":"So it's critical, if you're a young founder, to build things for yourself and your friends to use. The biggest mistake young founders make is to build something for some mysterious group of other people. But if you can make something that you and your friends truly want to use — something your friends aren't just using out of loyalty to you, but would be really sad to lose if you shut it down — then you almost certainly have the germ of a good startup idea. It may not seem like a startup to you. It may not be obvious how to make money from it. But trust me, there's a way.","chunk_id":"1411f3d714d808f16a1f58197234c18d"}

Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples.

Larry and Sergey weren't trying to start a company at first. They were just trying to make search better. Before Google, most search engines didn't try to sort the results they gave you in order of importance. If you searched for \"rugby\" they just gave you every web page that contained the word \"rugby.\" And the web was so small in 1997 that this actually worked! Kind of. There might only be 20 or 30 pages with the word \"rugby,\" but the web was growing exponentially, which meant this way of doing search was becoming exponentially more broken. Most users just thought, \"Wow, I sure have to look through a lot of search results to find what I want.\" Door sticks. But like Mark, Larry and Sergey were programmers.

You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your character.

{"question":"Why was it more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects fifty years ago?","answer":"It was more necessary to be part of an organization fifty years ago to access resources, colleagues, and distribution, as prestige and the ability to achieve much were often tied to organizational affiliation at that time.","chunk":"Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much.

{"question":"What is emphasized as the key factor in getting good at technology, according to the text?","answer":"Practice is emphasized as the key factor in getting good at technology, similar to getting good at the violin or football.","chunk":"So that's the first of the three things you need, to get good at some kind or kinds of technology. You do it the same way you get good at the violin or football: practice. If you start a startup at 22, and you start writing your own programs now, then by the time you start the company you'll have spent at least 7 years practicing writing code, and you can get pretty good at anything after practicing it for 7 years.","chunk_id":"7f3083273890cc5b640214085104b40d"}
{"question":"What is the significance of asking questions about things that are typically taken for granted, according to the text?","answer":"The significance of asking questions about things that are typically taken for granted, according to the text, is that many discoveries have come from this practice.","chunk":"The next step is to notice them. This takes some skill, because your brain wants to ignore such gaps in order to make a simpler model of the world. Many discoveries have come from asking questions about things that everyone else took for granted.","chunk_id":"9148c5207fb428dd48da5c04f61d5607"}
{"question":"How does sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantee the shape and magnitude of the return curve according to the text?","answer":"Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it's trivially small at first. Thresholds only guarantee the shape, not the magnitude.","chunk":"What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the form \"seek thresholds\" or \"seek competition?\" Here the situation is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette, you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the best case you're no better off. \"Seek competition\" is similarly useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve — because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it's trivially small at first — but thresholds only guarantee the shape.","chunk_id":"db822496ffae6ad17a6e0f0307aa55da"}
{"question":"How did Mark Zuckerberg address the issue of the lack of a university-wide online facebook at Harvard in 2002?","answer":"Mark Zuckerberg addressed the issue by allowing people to upload their own photos and combining the data into a new site for the whole university, which led to the creation of Facebook.","chunk":"So Mark Zuckerberg shows up at Harvard in 2002, and the university still hasn't gotten the facebook online. Each individual house has an online facebook, but there isn't one for the whole university. The university administration has been diligently having meetings about this, and will probably have solved the problem in another decade or so. Most of the students don't consciously notice that anything is wrong. But Mark is a programmer. He looks at this situation and thinks \"Well, this is stupid. I could write a program to fix this in one night. Just let people upload their own photos and then combine the data into a new site for the whole university.\" So he does. And almost literally overnight he has thousands of users.","chunk_id":"89e2387b62ad20b76b1af5196c84160d"}
{"question":"According to the text, what is essential in a startup idea and how can you identify such ideas?","answer":"In a startup idea, what you need is something your friends actually want. You can identify these ideas by being good at technology, as the text suggests.","chunk":"What you need in a startup idea, and all you need, is something your friends actually want. And those ideas aren't hard to see once you're good at technology. There are sticking doors everywhere.","chunk_id":"bd3afdf8933edef19ce4d1a61b547a93"}
