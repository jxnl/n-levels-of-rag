{"question":"What is the heuristic mentioned in the text to achieve superlinear returns?","answer":"The heuristic mentioned in the text to achieve superlinear returns is 'always be learning.'","chunk":"Indeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.","chunk_id":"1da26f4497b8e6a39455251021c98d61"}
{"question":"What language was intended to be used for defining applications in the software being built according to the text?","answer":"A dialect of Lisp","chunk":"Hmph. Well, I'd do it myself then. I recruited Dan Giffin, who had worked for Viaweb, and two undergrads who wanted summer jobs, and we got to work trying to build what it's now clear is about twenty companies and several open source projects worth of software. The language for defining applications would of course be a dialect of Lisp. But I wasn't so naive as to assume I could spring an overt Lisp on a general audience; we'd hide the parentheses, like Dylan did.","chunk_id":"ffd3df4c0449f04c100e47f707d35052"}
{"question":"What is the advice given regarding donating to nonprofits in the text?","answer":"The advice given is to donate unrestricted funds to nonprofits and trust them to decide how to allocate the money.","chunk":"You can't expect candor in a relationship so asymmetric. So I'll tell you what nonprofits wish they could tell you. If you want to donate to a nonprofit, donate unrestricted. If you trust them to spend your money, trust them to decide how.","chunk_id":"5f43a6814affdcd290e1a2eb1aab9315"}
{"question":"According to the text, what was Facebook considered before it became a startup?","answer":"Facebook was considered a project before it became a startup.","chunk":"Of course Facebook was not a startup yet. It was just a... project. There's that word again. Projects aren't just the best way to learn about technology. They're also the best source of startup ideas.","chunk_id":"2740f0b1e17186cacba76d013d7d3179"}
{"question":"What was the turning point for the author in figuring out what to work on?","answer":"The turning point for the author in figuring out what to work on was when they started publishing essays online.","chunk":"I've worked on several different things, but to the extent there was a turning point where I figured out what to work on, it was when I started publishing essays online. From then on I knew that whatever else I did, I'd always write essays too.","chunk_id":"88b6fcc2db37e479523151bee02fc3d1"}
{"question":"According to the text, what is the essential requirement for a startup idea?","answer":"Something your friends actually want.","chunk":"What you need in a startup idea, and all you need, is something your friends actually want.

{"question":"What are the two senses in which work can be considered one's own according to the text?","answer":"1) Doing it voluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to. 2) Doing it by yourself.","chunk":"So where exactly is the edge of projects of one's own? That's an interesting question, partly because the answer is so complicated, and partly because there's so much at stake. There turn out to be two senses in which work can be one's own: 1) that you're doing it voluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to, and 2) that you're doing it by yourself.","chunk_id":"7ee825a37a199d675d3a4b61683b1fa4"}
{"question":"What consequences did heretics face historically and in contemporary times, according to the text?","answer":"Historically, heretics faced death as punishment, while in contemporary times, they face job loss.","chunk":"Back in the day (and still, in some places) the punishment for heresy was death. You could have led a life of exemplary goodness, but if you publicly doubted, say, the divinity of Christ, you were going to burn. Nowadays, in civilized countries, heretics only get fired in the metaphorical sense, by losing their jobs. But the structure of the situation is the same: the heresy outweighs everything else. You could have spent the last ten years saving children's lives, but if you express certain opinions, you're automatically fired.","chunk_id":"78a893ba7cbc43791777a06a41780848"}

{"question":"Why did the author switch to AI when they were 18?","answer":"The author switched to AI at the age of 18 because they found philosophy courses boring.","chunk":"I couldn't have put this into words when I was 18.

{"question":"What challenges did herding face in achieving exponential growth according to the text?","answer":"Grazing land was the limiting factor for achieving exponential growth in herding, as there was no plan for growing it exponentially.","chunk":"What we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially.","chunk_id":"df602c06b072a9ee919034b1903bad01"}
{"question":"What caution does the text advise against when it comes to learning?","answer":"The text advises against overoptimizing what you're learning and limiting yourself to only learning things that are known to be valuable.","chunk":"But don't overoptimize what you're learning. Don't limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.","chunk_id":"4488c0b3bc69d52dfae583105d7cbc1f"}
{"question":"According to the text, what can adults benefit from in terms of their projects?","answer":"Adults can benefit from knowing that their projects are on a path that stretches back to treehouses and recapturing the careless confidence they had as kids when starting something new.","chunk":"But if we couldn't benefit as kids from the knowledge that our treehouses were on the path to grownup projects, we can at least benefit as grownups from knowing that our projects are on a path that stretches back to treehouses. Remember that careless confidence you had as a kid when starting something new? That would be a powerful thing to recapture.","chunk_id":"f9933aae0c74ac83373340684c7274bb"}
{"question":"Why does the author prefer children working on ambitious projects over getting good grades?","answer":"The author prefers children working on ambitious projects over getting good grades because real-world projects have more predictive value based on the author's experience with startup applicants for Y Combinator.","chunk":"If I had to choose between my kids getting good grades and working on ambitious projects of their own, I'd pick the projects. And not because I'm an indulgent parent, but because I've been on the other end and I know which has more predictive value. When I was picking startups for Y Combinator, I didn't care about applicants' grades. But if they'd worked on projects of their own, I wanted to hear all about those.","chunk_id":"f31119c5b994626c0264ad4a431ca248"}
{"question":"What was the subset that the author built as an open source project?","answer":"The subset that the author built as an open source project was a new Lisp dialect called Arc.","chunk":"The subset I would build as an open source project was the new Lisp, whose parentheses I now wouldn't even have to hide. A lot of Lisp hackers dream of building a new Lisp, partly because one of the distinctive features of the language is that it has dialects, and partly, I think, because we have in our minds a Platonic form of Lisp that all existing dialects fall short of. I certainly did. So at the end of the summer Dan and I switched to working on this new dialect of Lisp, which I called Arc, in a house I bought in Cambridge.","chunk_id":"4d90e8afe453b4859d6e3dc85a34537f"}

{"question":"Why is it important to understand the concept of superlinear returns according to the text?","answer":"It is important to understand the concept of superlinear returns because it is necessary for comprehending the world and benefiting from ambitious endeavors.","chunk":"You can't understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on.","chunk_id":"dbbec66cbef84b1763a53134c8e782da"}
{"question":"What was the name originally used to describe companies like Viaweb, before it was replaced by 'software as a service'?","answer":"The name originally used to describe companies like Viaweb was 'application service provider' (ASP).","chunk":"By then there was a name for the kind of company Viaweb was, an \"application service provider,\" or ASP. This name didn't last long before it was replaced by \"software as a service,\" but it was current for long enough that I named this new company after it: it was going to be called Aspra.","chunk_id":"a412a757724417877c961cf5852c741d"}
{"question":"What inspired Jessica to compile a book of interviews with startup founders?","answer":"Jessica was inspired to compile a book of interviews with startup founders after being surprised by the colorful stories of startup founders from the startup world.","chunk":"Jessica was in charge of marketing at a Boston investment bank. This bank thought it understood startups, but over the next year, as she met friends of mine from the startup world, she was surprised how different reality was. And how colorful their stories were.

{"question":"According to the text, what distinguishes technology from non-technology activities?","answer":"The critical distinction is whether you're producing or just consuming. For example, are you writing computer games, or just playing them?","chunk":"You don't have to learn programming, though. If you're wondering what counts as technology, it includes practically everything you could describe using the words \"make\" or \"build.\" So welding would count, or making clothes, or making videos. Whatever you're most interested in. The critical distinction is whether you're producing or just consuming. Are you writing computer games, or just playing them? That's the cutoff.","chunk_id":"7158d40157d16f1c2c96f0d7fe8104f4"}
{"question":"According to the text, why is it problematic to consider a statement as x-ist based on who said it?","answer":"Truth should not be dependent on the speaker's identity.","chunk":"The clearest evidence of this is that whether a statement is considered x-ist often depends on who said it. Truth doesn't work that way. The same statement can't be true when one person says it, but x-ist, and therefore false, when another person does.","chunk_id":"09dc7db69a1c13364dfbbdf340067ccf"}
{"question":"Why is individualized advice from YC partners important for startups according to the text?","answer":"Individualized advice from YC partners is important for startups because each startup is unique, and they need to be advised by specific partners who know them well.","chunk":"But knowing (nearly) all the problems startups can encounter doesn't mean that advising them can be automated, or reduced to a formula. There's no substitute for individual office hours with a YC partner. Each startup is unique, which means they have to be advised by specific partners who know them well.","chunk_id":"def4cccc187d3bf0fa5ec0ddcccefa61"}
{"question":"How long did it take the author to realize the implications of a significant development?","answer":"It took the author 8 years to realize the implications of a significant development.","chunk":"This had been possible in principle since 1993, but not many people had realized it yet. I had been intimately involved with building the infrastructure of the web for most of that time, and a writer as well, and it had taken me 8 years to realize it. Even then it took me several years to understand the implications. It meant there would be a whole new generation of essays.","chunk_id":"1863410773bb26bff16d1f71183cfe06"}
{"question":"What is the concern raised in the text regarding extremists who refuse to vaccinate their children or disrupt speakers at universities?","answer":"The concern is about the potential impact on society when the actions of extremists start to affect the lives of others.","chunk":"In both cases it's hard to know how much to worry. Is it really dangerous to society as a whole if a handful of extremists refuse to get their kids vaccinated, or shout down speakers at universities? The point to start worrying is presumably when their efforts start to spill over into everyone else's lives. And in both cases that does seem to be happening.","chunk_id":"f34c7ee51842da484b8594ee0d7bde87"}
{"question":"What is the analogy used to describe the difference between working on a personal project and ordinary work in the text?","answer":"The analogy used is that working on a personal project is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking.","chunk":"A few days ago, on the way home from school, my nine year old son told me he couldn't wait to get home to write more of the story he was working on. This made me as happy as anything I've heard him say — not just because he was excited about his story, but because he'd discovered this way of working. Working on a project of your own is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking. It's more fun, but also much more productive.","chunk_id":"4418c5a219d44eef4037ab26a9ed9601"}
{"question":"How do startups benefit from the natural alignment between skating and solving new problems?","answer":"Startups benefit from higher market prices of unsolved problems and a productivity discount when working on new problems.","chunk":"The natural alignment between skating and solving new problems is one of the reasons the payoffs from startups are so high. Not only is the market price of unsolved problems higher, you also get a discount on productivity when you work on them. In fact, you get a double increase in productivity: when you're doing a clean-sheet design, it's easier to recruit skaters, and they get to spend all their time skating.","chunk_id":"06a1d2ecf01e5715487c1db4cb89d408"}
{"question":"What emotions does the author associate with working on a project of their own, such as writing an essay?","answer":"The author associates feelings of worry and puzzlement with working on a project of their own, like writing an essay.","chunk":"There is something special about working on a project of your own. I wouldn't say exactly that you're happier. A better word would be excited, or engaged. You're happy when things are going well, but often they aren't. When I'm writing an essay, most of the time I'm worried and puzzled: worried that the essay will turn out badly, and puzzled because I'm groping for some idea that I can't see clearly enough. Will I be able to pin it down with words? In the end I usually can, if I take long enough, but I'm never sure; the first few attempts often fail.","chunk_id":"f3020c84b019b1b1ca2834a3fe76cb13"}
{"question":"Why was the time spent working on the specific topic not wasted according to the author?","answer":"The time spent was beneficial because after starting Y Combinator, the author encountered startups working on parts of the new architecture, making the prior efforts valuable.","chunk":"Much to my surprise, the time I spent working on this stuff was not wasted after all. After we started Y Combinator, I would often encounter startups working on parts of this new architecture, and it was very useful to have spent so much time thinking about it and even trying to write some of it.","chunk_id":"ce480ad6a44ce900e37e33f46a594c48"}
{"question":"What are the key steps to take in order to start a startup according to the text?","answer":"To start a startup, one needs to get good at technology by working on their own projects and perform well in school to get into a good university, where cofounders and ideas are located.","chunk":"So the list of what you need to do to get from here to starting a startup is quite short. You need to get good at technology, and the way to do that is to work on your own projects. And you need to do as well in school as you can, so you can get into a good university, because that's where the cofounders and the ideas are.","chunk_id":"f07ccedb98fa171dde6f29af7346f261"}
{"question":"What inspired the author to believe that there is such a thing as good taste in art?","answer":"The author's observation of Leonardo and Bellini being much better at painting than them inspired the belief that art can be good and there is such a thing as good taste.","chunk":"That was how I realized my father was wrong. I started studying painting. And it was just like other kinds of work I'd done: you could do it well, or badly, and if you tried hard, you could get better at it. And it was obvious that Leonardo and Bellini were much better at it than me. That gap between us was not imaginary. They were so good. And if they could be good, then art could be good, and there was such a thing as good taste after all.","chunk_id":"dacc125df200377e7d54d08ffe3dbb43"}
{"question":"What solution was adopted to address the problem with the batch of startups?","answer":"The solution adopted was to shard the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseen by a dedicated group of partners.","chunk":"The solution we adopted was the classic one in these situations. We sharded the batch into smaller groups of startups, each overseen by a dedicated group of partners. That fixed the problem, and has worked fine ever since. But the batch that broke YC was a powerful demonstration of how individualized the process of advising startups has to be.","chunk_id":"5dcbb9754771f78baf59392adcf0c3f4"}
{"question":"Why were things fine at 60 startups and broken at 80 according to the text?","answer":"Things were fine at 60 startups and broken at 80 because the algorithm being used was O(n2), causing a performance issue at higher numbers of startups.","chunk":"At first I was puzzled. How could things be fine at 60 startups and broken at 80? It was only a third more. Then I realized what had happened. We were using an O(n2) algorithm. So of course it blew up.","chunk_id":"1a3eac93a2d870ce0f8fde85ceee9b34"}
{"question":"What does the text refer to as a feature of the world, not an artifact of invented rules?","answer":"Superlinear returns for performance","chunk":"It's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer.","chunk_id":"7328e00298d2c1298c2e73bc1bf27c65"}
{"question":"What is highlighted about the problems faced by startups in the text?","answer":"The text emphasizes that most startups have similar problems, even though they may not be exactly the same, and after advising 100 startups with different products, familiar problems are often encountered.","chunk":"The first thing that came to mind was that most startups have the same problems. No two have exactly the same problems, but it's surprising how much the problems remain the same, regardless of what they're making. Once you've advised 100 startups all doing different things, you rarely encounter problems you haven't seen before.","chunk_id":"d8e80c242993729fa5fc848649d6e8ed"}
{"question":"What does the concept of superlinear returns imply according to the text?","answer":"Superlinear returns imply inequality because the steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes, suggesting that not everyone benefits equally from the returns.","chunk":"This point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes.","chunk_id":"9abb07037d57ea1ecc0f0e2916e1ce66"}
{"question":"What are the two fundamental causes behind situations with superlinear returns according to the text?","answer":"Exponential growth and thresholds are the two fundamental causes behind situations with superlinear returns.","chunk":"It may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.","chunk_id":"db968e1fa1109241432e0d983423a9ac"}
{"question":"What is the main challenge highlighted in the text regarding figuring out what to work on?","answer":"The main challenge highlighted in the text is that the system does not provide guidance on what to work on, leaving individuals to figure it out on their own without much support.","chunk":"It would be better if they at least admitted it — if they admitted that the system not only can't do much to help you figure out what to work on, but is designed on the assumption that you'll somehow magically guess as a teenager. They don't tell you, but I will: when it comes to figuring out what to work on, you're on your own. Some people get lucky and do guess correctly, but the rest will find themselves scrambling diagonally across tracks laid down on the assumption that everyone does.","chunk_id":"a28e7019d00dcc684374a9ab4f9de3c1"}
{"question":"How did the author's father, who was a mathematician, perceive math homework differently from most people?","answer":"The author's father viewed math homework as a new set of puzzles to solve, with the problems being the main focus rather than just a test or way to develop knowledge.","chunk":"For example, math homework is for most people something they're told to do. But for my father, who was a mathematician, it wasn't. Most of us think of the problems in a math book as a way to test or develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section. But to my father the problems were the part that mattered, and the text was merely a sort of annotation. Whenever he got a new math book it was to him like being given a puzzle: here was a new set of problems to solve, and he'd immediately set about solving all of them.","chunk_id":"dc826a70cec621d89bddd77f83759b8a"}
{"question":"How does the traditional school system influence students' attitudes towards work according to the text?","answer":"The traditional school system steers students toward dutiful and competitive work, potentially hindering creativity and individuality.","chunk":"It may be inevitable that school is the way it is. I'm not saying we have to redesign it (though I'm not saying we don't), just that we should understand what it does to our attitudes to work — that it steers us toward the dutiful plodding kind of work, often using competition as bait, and away from skating.","chunk_id":"7c8714e01f8eaacc42b1a1fbb6d7cc88"}
{"question":"Why does the author avoid mentioning specific heresies in the essay?","answer":"The author avoids mentioning specific heresies in the essay to ensure its future relevance and appeal to a broader audience. He acknowledges the presence of conventionally minded individuals who seek to forbid things based on an ideology, indicating that the current ideology may not be the last.","chunk":"And that's the second reason I've avoided mentioning any specific heresies. I want this essay to work in the future, not just now. And unfortunately it probably will. The aggressively conventional-minded will always be among us, looking for things to forbid. All they need is an ideology to tell them what. And it's unlikely the current one will be the last.","chunk_id":"942fbb847c6d343c368c1acfbfd42860"}

One day I went to visit the Carnegie Institute, where I'd spent a lot of time as a kid. While looking at a painting there I realized something that might seem obvious, but was a big surprise to me. There, right on the wall, was something you could make that would last. Paintings didn't become obsolete.

{"question":"Why are high standards considered harmful at the beginning of a project?","answer":"High standards are considered harmful at the beginning of a project because they can deter individuals from actually starting the project, leading to missed opportunities for potential success.","chunk":"The most important phase in a project of one's own is at the beginning: when you go from thinking it might be cool to do x to actually doing x. And at that point high standards are not merely useless but positively harmful. There are a few people who start too many new projects, but far more, I suspect, who are deterred by fear of failure from starting projects that would have succeeded if they had.","chunk_id":"06842bdfb7a766bc4d43cc0cc44ef75c"}
{"question":"What opportunities did the author believe were available for artists in terms of making a living?","answer":"The author believed that artists could make a living, though not as easily as writing software, by being industrious, living cheaply, and being truly independent without a boss or research funding.","chunk":"And moreover this was something you could make a living doing. Not as easily as you could by writing software, of course, but I thought if you were really industrious and lived really cheaply, it had to be possible to make enough to survive. And as an artist you could be truly independent. You wouldn't have a boss, or even need to get research funding.","chunk_id":"917bbd233788b24fbc88c3ea3c0f6989"}
{"question":"What did Steve Jobs understand about managing the right people based on his observation of skaters like Steve Wozniak?","answer":"Steve Jobs understood that by finding the right people, one only needs to instruct them at a high level, as they will handle the details themselves.","chunk":"Steve Jobs knew a thing or two about skaters from having watched Steve Wozniak. If you can find the right people, you only have to tell them what to do at the highest level. They'll handle the details. Indeed, they insist on it. For a project to feel like your own, you must have sufficient autonomy. You can't be working to order, or slowed down by bureaucracy.","chunk_id":"c934be7a88f7afb9272f779c480ae09c"}

{"question":"What prompted the author to shift focus from running a company to building an open source project?","answer":"The author realized that they didn't want to run a company, especially not a big one, and questioned why they were pursuing that path. As the vision required a company to be realized, the author decided to build a subset of the project as an open source project instead.","chunk":"I started working on the application builder, Dan worked on network infrastructure, and the two undergrads worked on the first two services (images and phone calls). But about halfway through the summer I realized I really didn't want to run a company — especially not a big one, which it was looking like this would have to be. I'd only started Viaweb because I needed the money. Now that I didn't need money anymore, why was I doing this? If this vision had to be realized as a company, then screw the vision.

{"question":"What inspired the author to write a book about Lisp hacking?","answer":"The author decided to focus on Lisp after salvaging his plans and realizing its interesting nature beyond AI. Writing a book about something helped him learn more about it.","chunk":"So I looked around to see what I could salvage from the wreckage of my plans, and there was Lisp. I knew from experience that Lisp was interesting for its own sake and not just for its association with AI, even though that was the main reason people cared about it at the time. So I decided to focus on Lisp. In fact, I decided to write a book about Lisp hacking. It's scary to think how little I knew about Lisp hacking when I started writing that book. But there's nothing like writing a book about something to help you learn it. The book, On Lisp, wasn't published till 1993, but I wrote much of it in grad school.","chunk_id":"6f072a7cea71ffe4c0302de46b77a480"}
{"question":"According to the text, why is it important to not be afraid to switch focus while working?","answer":"It is important to not be afraid to switch focus while working because fields, such as areas of interest or projects, do not require loyalty like people do.

{"question":"Why is it valuable for an experienced founder to participate in YC according to the text?","answer":"It is valuable for an experienced founder to participate in YC because YC partners have encyclopedic knowledge of startup problems that the founder can benefit from, complementing the founder's depth of domain knowledge.","chunk":"YC is not simply more experienced founders passing on their knowledge. It's more like specialization than apprenticeship. The knowledge of the YC partners and the founders have different shapes: It wouldn't be worthwhile for a founder to acquire the encyclopedic knowledge of startup problems that a YC partner has, just as it wouldn't be worthwhile for a YC partner to acquire the depth of domain knowledge that a founder has. That's why it can still be valuable for an experienced founder to do YC, just as it can still be valuable for an experienced athlete to have a coach.","chunk_id":"481e50078f5629007e5331067f4d86b0"}
{"question":"Why are restricted donations commonly seen as a bad idea according to the text?","answer":"Restricted donations are commonly seen as a bad idea because the way the donor wants the money spent may not align with the nonprofit's priorities, indicating that the nonprofit may have a better understanding of where the money needs to be spent.","chunk":"Restricted donations mean donations where the donor limits what can be done with the money. This is common with big donations, perhaps the default. And yet it's usually a bad idea. Usually the way the donor wants the money spent is not the way the nonprofit would have chosen. Otherwise there would have been no need to restrict the donation.

{"question":"What was the initial goal of Larry and Sergey when they started working on Google?","answer":"Larry and Sergey were initially focused on making search better, rather than starting a company.","chunk":"Ditto for Google. Larry and Sergey weren't trying to start a company at first. They were just trying to make search better. Before Google, most search engines didn't try to sort the results they gave you in order of importance. If you searched for \"rugby\" they just gave you every web page that contained the word \"rugby.\" And the web was so small in 1997 that this actually worked! Kind of. There might only be 20 or 30 pages with the word \"rugby,\" but the web was growing exponentially, which meant this way of doing search was becoming exponentially more broken. Most users just thought, \"Wow, I sure have to look through a lot of search results to find what I want.\" Door sticks. But like Mark, Larry and Sergey were programmers. Like Mark, they looked at this situation and thought \"Well, this is stupid. Some pages about rugby matter more than others.

{"question":"What are the two ways mentioned in the text to ensure autonomy without having a boss?","answer":"The two ways mentioned in the text are being your own boss and working on projects outside of work.","chunk":"One way to ensure autonomy is not to have a boss at all. There are two ways to do that: to be the boss yourself, and to work on projects outside of work. Though they're at opposite ends of the scale financially, startups and open source projects have a lot in common, including the fact that they're often run by skaters. And indeed, there's a wormhole from one end of the scale to the other: one of the best ways to discover startup ideas is to work on a project just for fun.","chunk_id":"9c8230b9e2a8a1e3a2a01b1338b490fc"}
{"question":"How does the text describe the difference between schoolwork and working on projects of one's own?","answer":"The text describes schoolwork as usually not being a project of one's own, unlike working on personal projects which allows for creativity and independence.","chunk":"Instead of telling kids that their treehouses could be on the path to the work they do as adults, we tell them the path goes through school. And unfortunately schoolwork tends to be very different from working on projects of one's own. It's usually neither a project, nor one's own. So as school gets more serious, working on projects of one's own is something that survives, if at all, as a thin thread off to the side.","chunk_id":"5f1b5a420bc6c81bae4d0d57b040f0d2"}
{"question":"What did the author work on for 4 years from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019?","answer":"The author worked on defining a complete programming language using McCarthy's axiomatic approach.","chunk":"Now they are, though. Now you could continue using McCarthy's axiomatic approach till you'd defined a complete programming language. And as long as every change you made to McCarthy's Lisp was a discoveredness-preserving transformation, you could, in principle, end up with a complete language that had this quality. Harder to do than to talk about, of course, but if it was possible in principle, why not try? So I decided to take a shot at it. It took 4 years, from March 26, 2015 to October 12, 2019. It was fortunate that I had a precisely defined goal, or it would have been hard to keep at it for so long.","chunk_id":"256870b48c8ee33e9901ba4f262a712a"}
{"question":"Why do founders often struggle to listen to advice according to the text?","answer":"Founders often struggle to listen to advice because much about startups is counterintuitive, and when they hear something counterintuitive, it sounds wrong to them, leading to a lack of belief in the advice given until they gain experience.","chunk":"It took me a long time to figure out why founders don't listen. At first I thought it was mere stubbornness. That's part of the reason, but another and probably more important reason is that so much about startups is counterintuitive. And when you tell someone something counterintuitive, what it sounds to them is wrong. So the reason founders don't listen to us is that they don't believe us. At least not till experience teaches them otherwise.","chunk_id":"a0f4a5795930ee7e52b5cf9d171ab60b"}

At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because there's less competition at the far end — and not just for the obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well, but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few even try.

{"question":"Why are founders uncertain about what to do according to the text?","answer":"Founders are uncertain about what to do partly because startups are doing something new, which means no one knows how to do it yet. Additionally, startups are counterintuitive, and many founders have been trained to win by hacking tests rather than developing necessary skills.","chunk":"Why are founders uncertain about what to do? Partly because startups almost by definition are doing something new, which means no one knows how to do it yet, or in most cases even what \"it\" is. Partly because startups are so counterintuitive generally. And partly because many founders, especially young and ambitious ones, have been trained to win the wrong way. That took me years to figure out. The educational system in most countries trains you to win by hacking the test instead of actually doing whatever it's supposed to measure. But that stops working when you start a startup. So part of what YC does is to retrain founders to stop trying to hack the test. (It takes a surprisingly long time. A year in, you still see them reverting to their old habits.)","chunk_id":"0acd8a32fa93b073000020aa46b4903d"}

It seemed, to my naive high school self, to be the study of the ultimate truths, compared to which the things studied in other fields would be mere domain knowledge.

{"question":"According to the text, what determines the corresponding property of an object in relation to its audience?","answer":"The extent to which an object acts upon its audience determines the corresponding property of the object.","chunk":"The solution to this puzzle is to realize that the purpose of art is to work on its human audience, and humans have a lot in common. And to the extent the things an object acts upon respond in the same way, that's arguably what it means for the object to have the corresponding property. If everything a particle interacts with behaves as if the particle had a mass of m, then it has a mass of m. So the distinction between \"objective\" and \"subjective\" is not binary, but a matter of degree, depending on how much the subjects have in common. Particles interacting with one another are at one pole, but people interacting with art are not all the way at the other; their reactions aren't random.","chunk_id":"bac1b337a501806a7dbf865bf6e61da4"}

But while I continued to work a good deal in Arc, I gradually stopped working on Arc, partly because I didn't have time to, and partly because it was a lot less attractive to mess around with the language now that we had all this infrastructure depending on it. So now my three projects were reduced to two: writing essays and working on YC.","chunk_id":"38a5ba4519684370a5aa9206bbf59c0d"}

{"question":"What led to the author's change of heart towards 'business'?","answer":"The author's change of heart towards 'business' was prompted by starting to get users, which led them to prioritize meeting user needs and being available for them.","chunk":"Though this felt wrong, it was exactly the right thing to be doing. Building stores for users taught us about retail, and about how it felt to use our software. I was initially both mystified and repelled by \"business\" and thought we needed a \"business person\" to be in charge of it, but once we started to get users, I was converted, in much the same way I was converted to fatherhood once I had kids. Whatever users wanted, I was all theirs. Maybe one day we'd have so many users that I couldn't scan their images for them, but in the meantime there was nothing more important to do.","chunk_id":"33d0db12d5957692c7b8d4da8ffd784a"}
{"question":"According to the text, how are opinions treated when they are considered heresies?","answer":"Opinions considered heresies are treated like crimes, and expressing them can make people feel that punishment is warranted, sometimes even more strongly than for an actual crime.","chunk":"A heresy is an opinion whose expression is treated like a crime — one that makes some people feel not merely that you're mistaken, but that you should be punished. Indeed, their desire to see you punished is often stronger than it would be if you'd committed an actual crime. There are many on the far left who believe strongly in the reintegration of felons (as I do myself), and yet seem to feel that anyone guilty of certain heresies should never work again.","chunk_id":"2f6402fb6d639e2dbfdd3bde8a7b97ad"}
{"question":"What does the text suggest about equating work with a job?","answer":"The text suggests that for individuals like writers, artists, and scientists, work is not restricted to a job but includes their creative endeavors, challenging the conventional view that productivity is tied to employment.","chunk":"There's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the 20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job. Even now to most people the phrase \"your work\" means their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of their portfolio.","chunk_id":"2898d385fce8316b87a7f211ae718106"}
{"question":"Why are newly founded companies more valuable according to the text?","answer":"Newly founded companies are more valuable because they grow faster than they used to, thanks to technological advancements, making them more valuable.","chunk":"But there's also a third factor at work: the companies themselves are more valuable, because newly founded companies grow faster than they used to.

{"question":"What was considered the prestigious route in 1960 according to the text?","answer":"Working your way up the corporate ladder at an existing company.","chunk":"In 1960, most of the people who start startups today would have gone to work for one of them. You could get rich from starting your own company in 1890 and in 2020, but in 1960 it was not really a viable option. You couldn't break through the oligopolies to get at the markets. So the prestigious route in 1960 was not to start your own company, but to work your way up the corporate ladder at an existing one.","chunk_id":"0b82b4e0e856773bd7578e096d04f7c0"}
{"question":"Why does the author believe that working on things that are not prestigious has been successful for them?","answer":"The author believes that working on non-prestigious things has been successful for them because examples from their life, such as still life painting, Viaweb, Y Combinator, and writing essays, have proven this to be true. Despite the lack of prestige, these endeavors have been fruitful for the author.","chunk":"One of the most conspicuous patterns I've noticed in my life is how well it has worked, for me at least, to work on things that weren't prestigious. Still life has always been the least prestigious form of painting. Viaweb and Y Combinator both seemed lame when we started them. I still get the glassy eye from strangers when they ask what I'm writing, and I explain that it's an essay I'm going to publish on my web site.

{"question":"According to the text, what effect did making everyone a corporate employee have on economic inequality?","answer":"Making everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality.","chunk":"Making everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality (and every other kind of variation), but if your model of normal is the mid 20th century, you have a very misleading model in that respect. J. P. Morgan's economy turned out to be just a phase, and starting in the 1970s, it began to break up.","chunk_id":"92fc9e9c95508baa89226b86cdee1c2f"}
{"question":"Why is it difficult to determine what kind of work to focus on according to the text?","answer":"It is challenging to determine what kind of work to focus on because most types of work can only be understood through experience, which requires investing time and effort before knowing one's proficiency or interest.","chunk":"Let's talk a little more about the complicated business of figuring out what to work on. The main reason it's hard is that you can't tell what most kinds of work are like except by doing them. Which means the four steps overlap: you may have to work at something for years before you know how much you like it or how good you are at it. And in the meantime you're not doing, and thus not learning about, most other kinds of work. So in the worst case you choose late based on very incomplete information.","chunk_id":"470840d04216b431020a54ca5d655db7"}
{"question":"What did the programs like SHRDLU demonstrate about natural language and formal language?","answer":"The programs like SHRDLU demonstrated that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language, but a very proper subset, highlighting the gap between computational capabilities and true understanding of natural language.","chunk":"What these programs really showed was that there's a subset of natural language that's a formal language. But a very proper subset. It was clear that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural language. It was not, in fact, simply a matter of teaching SHRDLU more words. That whole way of doing AI, with explicit data structures representing concepts, was not going to work. Its brokenness did, as so often happens, generate a lot of opportunities to write papers about various band-aids that could be applied to it, but it was never going to get us Mike.","chunk_id":"85017506dd6b2b8bba9d373bd13bfb12"}

P. Morgan's economy. There was also pressure from without, in the form of new technology, and particularly microelectronics.

{"question":"What programming language did the author learn in order to teach himself AI, and why?","answer":"The author learned Lisp in order to teach himself AI because Lisp was regarded as the language of AI during that time period.","chunk":"There weren't any classes in AI at Cornell then, not even graduate classes, so I started trying to teach myself. Which meant learning Lisp, since in those days Lisp was regarded as the language of AI. The commonly used programming languages then were pretty primitive, and programmers' ideas correspondingly so. The default language at Cornell was a Pascal-like language called PL/I, and the situation was similar elsewhere. Learning Lisp expanded my concept of a program so fast that it was years before I started to have a sense of where the new limits were. This was more like it; this was what I had expected college to do. It wasn't happening in a class, like it was supposed to, but that was ok. For the next couple years I was on a roll.

{"question":"According to the text, how does the author view the concept of 'work/life balance'?","answer":"The author considers insisting on 'work/life balance' a mistake and believes that work and life should not be seen as distinct entities, especially when working on projects one is passionate about.","chunk":"In Andy Hertzfeld's book on the Macintosh, he describes how they'd come back into the office after dinner and work late into the night. People who've never experienced the thrill of working on a project they're excited about can't distinguish this kind of working long hours from the kind that happens in sweatshops and boiler rooms, but they're at opposite ends of the spectrum. That's why it's a mistake to insist dogmatically on \"work/life balance.\" Indeed, the mere expression \"work/life\" embodies a mistake: it assumes work and life are distinct. For those to whom the word \"work\" automatically implies the dutiful plodding kind, they are. But for the skaters, the relationship between work and life would be better represented by a dash than a slash.

For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're interested in, and to find ways to work on it. It will also be important to choose work that suits your circumstances.

{"question":"What are the exceptions to the principle of making unrestricted donations to nonprofits according to the text?","answer":"The exceptions are donations to umbrella organizations and donors who are as informed as the nonprofit about where the money should be spent.","chunk":"There are a couple exceptions to this principle. One is when the nonprofit is an umbrella organization. It's reasonable to make a restricted donation to a university, for example, because a university is only nominally a single nonprofit. Another exception is when the donor actually does know as much as the nonprofit about where money needs to be spent. The Gates Foundation, for example, has specific goals and often makes restricted donations to individual nonprofits to accomplish them. But unless you're a domain expert yourself or donating to an umbrella organization, your donation would do more good if it were unrestricted.","chunk_id":"5f44f148094cdb7723f5db36a5671489"}

But attention is a zero sum game. If you can choose what to work on, and you choose a project that's not the best one (or at least a good one) for you, then it's getting in the way of another project that is.

This was not as strange as it sounds, because I was only 25, and art schools are full of people of different ages.

Instead of deciding for myself what to work on, the problems came to me. Every 6 months there was a new batch of startups, and their problems, whatever they were, became our problems.

{"question":"What does the text suggest about being drawn to unprestigious work and having the right motives?","answer":"The text suggests that being drawn to unprestigious work despite its lack of prestige indicates that there is something real to be discovered there and that it reflects having the right motives, which can prevent one from being led astray by impure motives like the desire to impress others.","chunk":"It's not that unprestigious types of work are good per se. But when you find yourself drawn to some kind of work despite its current lack of prestige, it's a sign both that there's something real to be discovered there, and that you have the right kind of motives. Impure motives are a big danger for the ambitious. If anything is going to lead you astray, it will be the desire to impress people. So while working on things that aren't prestigious doesn't guarantee you're on the right track, it at least guarantees you're not on the most common type of wrong one.","chunk_id":"906af681659a7b30e5ad57f986937f4c"}

{"question":"Why do YC partners usually have been founders themselves, according to the text?","answer":"YC partners usually have been founders themselves to understand the counterintuitive nature of startups, which is crucial for providing valuable advice to founders.","chunk":"The reason startups are so counterintuitive is that they're so different from most people's other experiences. No one knows what it's like except those who've done it. Which is why YC partners should usually have been founders themselves.

It shades gradually into collaboration. And interestingly, it shades into collaboration in two different ways. One way to collaborate is to share a single project. For example, when two mathematicians collaborate on a proof that takes shape in the course of a conversation between them. The other way is when multiple people work on separate projects of their own that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.

This seemed strange advice, because YC was doing great. But if there was one thing rarer than Rtm offering advice, it was Rtm being wrong. So this set me thinking. It was true that on my current trajectory, YC would be the last thing I did, because it was only taking up more of my attention. It had already eaten Arc, and was in the process of eating essays too. Either YC was my life's work or I'd have to leave eventually. And it wasn't, so I would.","chunk_id":"0fe356d6b2b330f04688b4ebe8add2dc"}
{"question":"How did the discovery mentioned in the text impact startup funding and the experience of founders?","answer":"The discovery of funding startups in batches was convenient for both the funding entity and the startups. It addressed the issue of isolation faced by founders by providing them with colleagues who could relate to their challenges and share solutions.","chunk":"Fairly quickly I realized that we had stumbled upon the way to scale startup funding. Funding startups in batches was more convenient for us, because it meant we could do things for a lot of startups at once, but being part of a batch was better for the startups too. It solved one of the biggest problems faced by founders: the isolation. Now you not only had colleagues, but colleagues who understood the problems you were facing and could tell you how they were solving them.","chunk_id":"eb8f290a84821542a61990620cefb162"}
{"question":"What advantage do Y Combinator (YC) partners have over later stage investors in terms of startup advising experience?","answer":"YC partners have the advantage of advising a large number of startups, gaining insights into recurring problems, unlike later stage investors who may not have the same breadth of experience.","chunk":"This fact is one of the things that makes YC work. But I didn't know it when we started YC. I only had a few data points: our own startup, and those started by friends. It was a surprise to me how often the same problems recur in different forms. Many later stage investors might never realize this, because later stage investors might not advise 100 startups in their whole career, but a YC partner will get this much experience in the first year or two.","chunk_id":"3a7109fc89084ff87a5a21794f645286"}
{"question":"What lesson could adults learn from kids when working on projects, according to the text?","answer":"Adults could learn to dive into projects without overthinking and worrying about high standards, similar to how kids approach building their treehouses.","chunk":"If your projects are the kind that make money, it's easy to work on them. It's harder when they're not. And the hardest part, usually, is morale. That's where adults have it harder than kids. Kids just plunge in and build their treehouse without worrying about whether they're wasting their time, or how it compares to other treehouses. And frankly we could learn a lot from kids here. The high standards most grownups have for \"real\" work do not always serve us well.","chunk_id":"c7948eeeb3f21e6629208ae95d455e71"}
{"question":"According to the text, who should aim for superlinear returns?","answer":"Ambitious people of two types: those who know they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to risk trying it to find out.","chunk":"Without the damping effect of institutions, there will be more variation in outcomes. Which doesn't imply everyone will be better off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly will do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for superlinear returns?

{"question":"Why is it important to have unique insights in investing, according to the text?","answer":"It is important to have unique insights in investing because if everyone else already believes in a company's potential, its stock price will reflect that consensus, leaving no room for profit.","chunk":"This is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers saying things that other people have already said. But it's just as true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that a company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will already reflect that, and there's no room to make money.","chunk_id":"f3ac444fb0f069f38be7d9230d2c5e89"}
{"question":"What motivates programmers to rewrite code or create their own versions of existing software, according to the text?","answer":"Programmers are motivated to rewrite code or create their own versions of existing software because writing code from scratch is much more rewarding, despite the potential waste of characters. This behavior is not solely driven by arrogance or cluelessness but can be advantageous and rewarding, even leading to better outcomes in some cases. Capitalism also plays a role in motivating companies to rewrite software to create their own solutions.","chunk":"Of course, it's easier to achieve this level of motivation when you're making something like the Macintosh. It's easy for something new to feel like a project of your own. That's one of the reasons for the tendency programmers have to rewrite things that don't need rewriting, and to write their own versions of things that already exist. This sometimes alarms managers, and measured by total number of characters typed, it's rarely the optimal solution. But it's not always driven simply by arrogance or cluelessness. Writing code from scratch is also much more rewarding — so much more rewarding that a good programmer can end up net ahead, despite the shocking waste of characters. Indeed, it may be one of the advantages of capitalism that it encourages such rewriting. A company that needs software to do something can't use the software already written to do it at another company, and thus has to write their own, which often turns out better.","chunk_id":"6725647917a6887e850f954eb19dac4a"}
{"question":"How does fame exhibit superlinear returns according to the text?","answer":"Fame exhibits superlinear returns by growing exponentially as existing fans attract new ones and by being concentrated due to thresholds, such as the limited space on the A-list in people's minds.","chunk":"Fame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it's so concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the A-list in the average person's head.","chunk_id":"77c6e6c7476ef762ff83489a57bf1c18"}
{"question":"Why did the author feel pressured by the audience during the talk?","answer":"The author felt pressured by the audience because they were all looking expectantly at him, expecting him to be a source of seed funding and advice.","chunk":"So I gave this talk, in the course of which I told them that the best sources of seed funding were successful startup founders, because then they'd be sources of advice too. Whereupon it seemed they were all looking expectantly at me. Horrified at the prospect of having my inbox flooded by business plans (if I'd only known), I blurted out \"But not me!\" and went on with the talk.

{"question":"What method does the author use to argue against the idea that there is no such thing as good taste?","answer":"The author uses a proof by reductio ad absurdum to argue against the idea that there is no such thing as good taste.","chunk":"It seemed so obvious that there was no such thing as good taste that it was only through indirect evidence that I realized my father was wrong. And that's what I'm going to give you here: a proof by reductio ad absurdum. If we start from the premise that there's no such thing as good taste, we end up with conclusions that are obviously false, and therefore the premise must be wrong.","chunk_id":"cd7179afb962c4778680ac6b624f1f64"}
{"question":"How did the author view online essays initially, and how did his perception change over time?","answer":"The author initially viewed online essays as a marginal medium, resembling rants on personal websites. However, he found this perception encouraging as he realized the potential of online essays.","chunk":"I knew that online essays would be a marginal medium at first.

{"question":"According to the text, how is good taste defined in the narrow sense?","answer":"Good taste in the narrow sense refers to aesthetic judgments, specifically in the context of art preferences.","chunk":"We'd better start by saying what good taste is. There's a narrow sense in which it refers to aesthetic judgements and a broader one in which it refers to preferences of any kind. The strongest proof would be to show that taste exists in the narrowest sense, so I'm going to talk about taste in art.

{"question":"What was the main difference between publishing content in the print era and the online era, as mentioned in the text?","answer":"The main difference was the accessibility to an audience. In the print era, there was a narrow channel to readers controlled by editors, while in the online era, anyone can publish content and reach an audience.","chunk":"Wow, I thought, there's an audience. If I write something and put it on the web, anyone can read it. That may seem obvious now, but it was surprising then. In the print era there was a narrow channel to readers, guarded by fierce monsters known as editors.

{"question":"What advice does the text provide for young founders when building products?","answer":"The text advises young founders to build products for themselves and their friends to use, rather than for an unknown group. They should create something that friends truly want to use and would be sad to lose if it were shut down, as this can indicate a good startup idea.","chunk":"So it's critical, if you're a young founder, to build things for yourself and your friends to use. The biggest mistake young founders make is to build something for some mysterious group of other people. But if you can make something that you and your friends truly want to use — something your friends aren't just using out of loyalty to you, but would be really sad to lose if you shut it down — then you almost certainly have the germ of a good startup idea. It may not seem like a startup to you. It may not be obvious how to make money from it. But trust me, there's a way.","chunk_id":"1411f3d714d808f16a1f58197234c18d"}

For example, that if you could only have a small image of a man's shirt (and all images were small then by present standards), it was better to have a closeup of the collar than a picture of the whole shirt.

What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up.

It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening.

Society is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, your parents won't freak out the way they would have a generation ago, and knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread.

{"question":"How did ignorance work in the author's favor as an angel investor in Boston in 2005?","answer":"Ignorance worked in the author's favor as they had no guidance from experienced investors like Ron Conway in Boston in 2005. This led them to make choices based on what seemed obvious, resulting in some innovative outcomes.","chunk":"Once again, ignorance worked in our favor. We had no idea how to be angel investors, and in Boston in 2005 there were no Ron Conways to learn from. So we just made what seemed like the obvious choices, and some of the things we did turned out to be novel.","chunk_id":"a0fa2df4f5940ea7b222af0772448f79"}
{"question":"What shift in power dynamics is highlighted in the text regarding the emperors of ideas and territory?","answer":"The shift in power dynamics highlighted in the text is that the emperors of ideas now have the ability to design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory.","chunk":"That has changed in the last few centuries. Now the emperors of ideas can design bombs that defeat the emperors of territory. But this phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated it. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances of it.","chunk_id":"33c6bdee8026ab3879ceb1dda63baee8"}
{"question":"Why do some people doubt that art can be good according to the text?","answer":"Some people doubt that art can be good because the goodness of art seems to be something happening in the heads of each observer, rather than a property of the object itself, leading to potential disagreements among observers.","chunk":"The other reason people doubt that art can be good is that there doesn't seem to be any room in the art for this goodness. The argument goes like this. Imagine several people looking at a work of art and judging how good it is. If being good art really is a property of objects, it should be in the object somehow. But it doesn't seem to be; it seems to be something happening in the heads of each of the observers. And if they disagree, how do you choose between them?","chunk_id":"5598a2a2038cb59ffb1b5b72b853fc11"}
{"question":"How were investments made in startups according to the information in the text chunk?","answer":"Investments in startups were made by investing $6k per founder, totaling $12k in a two-founder scenario, in return for 6% equity. This deal was considered fair as it was twice as good as the deal the authors had previously taken. Additionally, Jessica provided free air conditioners to the founders during the first summer.","chunk":"The deal for startups was based on a combination of the deal we did with Julian ($10k for 10%) and what Robert said MIT grad students got for the summer ($6k). We invested $6k per founder, which in the typical two-founder case was $12k, in return for 6%. That had to be fair, because it was twice as good as the deal we ourselves had taken.

The stroke destroyed her balance, and she was put in a nursing home, but she really wanted to get out of it and back to her house, and my sister and I were determined to help her do it.

{"question":"What is one of the reasons cited in the text for the increase in America's Gini coefficient?","answer":"The increase in America's Gini coefficient is attributed to more people starting more valuable companies, leading to better terms from investors and higher company valuations.","chunk":"It's easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been. That means more people start them, that those who do get better terms from investors, and that the resulting companies become more valuable. Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that startups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don't have to resort to some vague right turn the country took under Reagan to explain why America's Gini coefficient is increasing. Of course the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people starting more valuable companies, how could it not be?","chunk_id":"525030549841571a2c86cfa2146cdf08"}
{"question":"Why did the author ban themselves from writing essays during a certain time period?","answer":"The author banned themselves from writing essays to be able to finish their work on the codebase called Bel, as they found it difficult to understand the convoluted code after spending time on essays.","chunk":"I had to ban myself from writing essays during most of this time, or I'd never have finished. In late 2015 I spent 3 months writing essays, and when I went back to working on Bel I could barely understand the code. Not so much because it was badly written as because the problem is so convoluted. When you're working on an interpreter written in itself, it's hard to keep track of what's happening at what level, and errors can be practically encrypted by the time you get them.","chunk_id":"69d409c530334e5e3be059b780c9a7da"}

Disputes between cofounders, figuring out when people were lying to us, fighting with people who maltreated the startups, and so on. But I worked hard even at the parts I didn't like. I was haunted by something Kevin Hale once said about companies: \"No one works harder than the boss.\" He meant it both descriptively and prescriptively, and it was the second part that scared me. I wanted YC to be good, so if how hard I worked set the upper bound on how hard everyone else worked, I'd better work very hard.","chunk_id":"45d2c96e18a81137333b56e5e1345aa3"}
{"question":"How has the world changed in terms of opportunities for individuals to pursue ambitious projects compared to the past?","answer":"The world has shifted towards providing more freedom for individuals to pursue ambitious projects, with increased opportunities for learning, earning money, finding colleagues, and reaching audiences. This contrasts with the past dominance of organizations that damped variation in performance returns.","chunk":"A world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists and writers had in the 20th century.

In early 2005 she interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm. It took them weeks to make up their minds, and during this time I started telling her about all the things that needed to be fixed about venture capital.

{"question":"According to the text, what distinguishes research problems likely to lead to new discoveries from those that are not?","answer":"Research problems likely to lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying but perhaps unimportant, while those that are not likely to lead to new discoveries can seem legit but boring.","chunk":"It would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research problem isn't likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism — to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what you're supposed to.","chunk_id":"cb936b553f33af9b313db30bd9e2fce7"}

{"question":"According to the text, what is the implication of discarding the concept of good taste on artists' abilities?","answer":"Discarding the concept of good taste implies that artists cannot be good at their jobs, including visual artists, actors, novelists, composers, and dancers.","chunk":"So if you want to discard the concept of good taste, you also have to discard the concept of good art. And that means you have to discard the possibility of people being good at making it. Which means there's no way for artists to be good at their jobs. And not just visual artists, but anyone who is in any sense an artist. You can't have good actors, or novelists, or composers, or dancers either.

I'll give you a real world example. Back in the 20th century, American universities used to publish printed directories with all the students' names and contact info. When I tell you what these directories were called, you'll know which startup I'm talking about.

{"question":"Why does Y Combinator encourage founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers?","answer":"Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers to prevent early discouragement, help in deciding what to focus on, and achieve exponential growth.","chunk":"Y Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially.","chunk_id":"1a7ffb66eee2c0776a951b980216c488"}
{"question":"What did the author realize about the importance of growth rate for a startup's success?","answer":"The author realized that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup's success, as it determines profitability and control over destiny in the long term.","chunk":"Another thing I didn't get at the time is that growth rate is the ultimate test of a startup. Our growth rate was fine. We had about 70 stores at the end of 1996 and about 500 at the end of 1997. I mistakenly thought the thing that mattered was the absolute number of users. And that is the thing that matters in the sense that that's how much money you're making, and if you're not making enough, you might go out of business. But in the long term the growth rate takes care of the absolute number. If we'd been a startup I was advising at Y Combinator, I would have said: Stop being so stressed out, because you're doing fine. You're growing 7x a year. Just don't hire too many more people and you'll soon be profitable, and then you'll control your own destiny.","chunk_id":"0d23a6794aa40aa9c55fa0e17b505f13"}

He wanted to engage their intellectual curiosity, so he changed the name and topic to Hacker News and made it about topics that engaged one's intellectual curiosity.","chunk":"In the summer of 2006, Robert and I started working on a new version of Arc. This one was reasonably fast, because it was compiled into Scheme. To test this new Arc, I wrote Hacker News in it. It was originally meant to be a news aggregator for startup founders and was called Startup News, but after a few months I got tired of reading about nothing but startups.

Indeed, the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.","chunk_id":"ac467b98b11b5e5e4e07b50029e90fe0"}
{"question":"How do superlinear returns and exponential growth intersect in scenarios like battles and market competition?","answer":"Superlinear returns and exponential growth intersect in scenarios like battles and market competition by showing that crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth, and exponential growth helps in crossing thresholds. For example, the winning side in battles suffers less damage, making them more likely to win in the future, while in markets with network effects, fast-growing companies can shut out potential competitors.","chunk":"It's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.","chunk_id":"04d0a09058f56e15d07449f52c5ce15a"}

If all I'd had to do was select and help founders, life would have been so easy. And that implies that HN was a mistake. Surely the biggest source of stress in one's work should at least be something close to the core of the work. Whereas I was like someone who was in pain while running a marathon not from the exertion of running, but because I had a blister from an ill-fitting shoe.

{"question":"How did McCarthy test his interpreter in the early stages of Lisp development?","answer":"McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs.","chunk":"McCarthy's 1960 Lisp did nothing more than interpret Lisp expressions. It was missing a lot of things you'd want in a programming language. So these had to be added, and when they were, they weren't defined using McCarthy's original axiomatic approach. That wouldn't have been feasible at the time. McCarthy tested his interpreter by hand-simulating the execution of programs. But it was already getting close to the limit of interpreters you could test that way — indeed, there was a bug in it that McCarthy had overlooked. To test a more complicated interpreter, you'd have had to run it, and computers then weren't powerful enough.","chunk_id":"8c6fce619d64ddd8ef73ebe925d276d9"}

{"question":"According to the text, why is it challenging to judge art effectiveness?","answer":"Judging art effectiveness is challenging because it cannot be measured simply by taking a vote, like with vaccines. It requires considering the responses of individuals with deep art knowledge and the ability to ignore external influences. There is variability in people's preferences, making judging art, especially contemporary pieces, difficult.","chunk":"The situation with art is messier, of course. You can't measure effectiveness by simply taking a vote, as you do with vaccines. You have to imagine the responses of subjects with a deep knowledge of art, and enough clarity of mind to be able to ignore extraneous influences like the fame of the artist. And even then you'd still see some disagreement. People do vary, and judging art is hard, especially recent art. There is definitely not a total order either of works or of people's ability to judge them. But there is equally definitely a partial order of both.

I worked on it so intensively that at any given time I had a decent chunk of the code in my head and could write more there. I remember taking the boys to the coast on a sunny day in 2015 and figuring out how to deal with some problem involving continuations while I watched them play in the tide pools.

{"question":"What term does the text propose for the search for alien truth?","answer":"Philosophy","chunk":"What should we call the search for alien truth? The obvious choice is \"philosophy.\" Whatever else philosophy includes, it should probably include this. I'm fairly sure Aristotle would have thought so. One could even make the case that the search for alien truth is, if not an accurate description of philosophy, a good definition for it. I.e. that it's what people who call themselves philosophers should be doing, whether or not they currently are. But I'm not wedded to that; doing it is what matters, not what we call it.","chunk_id":"c390a7a85c53925f0b32648a4a907c07"}
{"question":"How does fast growth impact the value of founders' stock according to the text?","answer":"Fast growth increases the value of founders' stock because a company's value is determined by its revenue and growth rate. Faster growth leads to reaching a higher revenue level sooner, making the company more valuable.","chunk":"Fast growth has a double effect on the value of founders' stock. The value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growth rate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billion dollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when it reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower.","chunk_id":"87ee9b18ef36b2574965b698c3bb67cc"}

{"question":"How does the text compare the design of art to the effectiveness of a vaccine in conferring immunity?","answer":"The text compares the design of art to operate on people effectively to the effectiveness of a vaccine in conferring immunity, highlighting that both can be good or bad based on how well they achieve their intended outcomes.","chunk":"Because people's responses to art aren't random, art can be designed to operate on people, and be good or bad depending on how effectively it does so. Much as a vaccine can be. If someone were talking about the ability of a vaccine to confer immunity, it would seem very frivolous to object that conferring immunity wasn't really a property of vaccines, because acquiring immunity is something that happens in the immune system of each individual person. Sure, people's immune systems vary, and a vaccine that worked on one might not work on another, but that doesn't make it meaningless to talk about the effectiveness of a vaccine.","chunk_id":"3f040473c7cf6af7ada92c5e76a5d7bf"}
{"question":"Why does the author like painting still lives?","answer":"The author likes painting still lives because it requires looking more closely at the subject and observing finer details that are typically overlooked in everyday visual perception.","chunk":"I liked painting still lives because I was curious about what I was seeing. In everyday life, we aren't consciously aware of much we're seeing. Most visual perception is handled by low-level processes that merely tell your brain \"that's a water droplet\" without telling you details like where the lightest and darkest points are, or \"that's a bush\" without telling you the shape and position of every leaf. This is a feature of brains, not a bug. In everyday life it would be distracting to notice every leaf on every bush. But when you have to paint something, you have to look more closely, and when you do there's a lot to see. You can still be noticing new things after days of trying to paint something people usually take for granted, just as you can after days of trying to write an essay about something people usually take for granted.","chunk_id":"0beddcca69f84e704f5929e3e5f01a93"}

There was a way to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn't affect customs very much.

{"question":"What common mistake do founders make when identifying their startup problems, as highlighted in the text?","answer":"Founders often mistake surface-level issues, like raising money or user acquisition challenges, for the true underlying problem, such as the quality of their product.","chunk":"Another related surprise is how bad founders can be at realizing what their problems are. Founders will sometimes come in to talk about some problem, and we'll discover another much bigger one in the course of the conversation. For example (and this case is all too common), founders will come in to talk about the difficulties they're having raising money, and after digging into their situation, it turns out the reason is that the company is doing badly, and investors can tell. Or founders will come in worried that they still haven't cracked the problem of user acquisition, and the reason turns out to be that their product isn't good enough. There have been times when I've asked \"Would you use this yourself, if you hadn't built it?\" and the founders, on thinking about it, said \"No.\" Well, there's the reason you're having trouble getting users.","chunk_id":"c4ac6d2f294b8b3ed3836388559e6157"}

{"question":"Why did the author feel a huge relief when Yahoo bought their company, Viaweb?","answer":"The author felt a huge relief when Yahoo bought their company, Viaweb, because despite the company being profitable and growing rapidly, the author felt uncertain about the actual value of their stock due to the frequent near-death experiences they faced. The acquisition by Yahoo felt like going from rags to riches for the author, prompting them to make a significant purchase of a car. This marked a shift from their previous grad student lifestyle.","chunk":"It was a huge relief when Yahoo bought us. In principle our Viaweb stock was valuable. It was a share in a business that was profitable and growing rapidly. But it didn't feel very valuable to me; I had no idea how to value a business, but I was all too keenly aware of the near-death experiences we seemed to have every few months. Nor had I changed my grad student lifestyle significantly since we started. So when Yahoo bought us it felt like going from rags to riches.

At the time I thought Yahoo was so overvalued that they'd never be worth anything, but to my astonishment the stock went up 5x in the next year. I hung on till the first chunk of options vested, then in the summer of 1999 I left. It had been so long since I'd painted anything that I'd half forgotten why I was doing this.

Up till that point we treated the partners as a pool. When a startup requested office hours, they got the next available slot posted by any partner. That meant every partner had to know every startup. This worked fine up to 60 startups, but when the batch grew to 80, everything broke.

The computer that made Apple really big, the Macintosh, came out at just the moment when computers got powerful enough to make letters like the ones in printed books instead of the computery-looking letters you see in 8 bit games. Apple destroyed everyone else at this, and one reason was that Steve was one of the few people in the computer business who really got graphic design.","chunk_id":"980edb7442a1c0b4847d9c01d2d087a6"}

Some of these thresholds are akin to machine tools: once you learn to read, you're able to learn anything else much faster. But the most important thresholds of all are those representing new discoveries. Knowledge seems to be fractal in the sense that if you push hard at the boundary of one area of knowledge, you sometimes discover a whole new field. And if you do, you get first crack at all the new discoveries to be made in it. Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin.","chunk_id":"3b86e15f1e92e1df9dc1d9baba3c6ec5"}

Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your curiosity.

{"question":"What is the difference between painting still lives and painting people, according to the text?","answer":"The text explains that painting still lives involves capturing static subjects that don't move, allowing for detailed replication, while painting people requires modifying a generic representation to match the specific individual, due to movement constraints.","chunk":"While I was a student at the Accademia I started painting still lives in my bedroom at night. These paintings were tiny, because the room was, and because I painted them on leftover scraps of canvas, which was all I could afford at the time. Painting still lives is different from painting people, because the subject, as its name suggests, can't move. People can't sit for more than about 15 minutes at a time, and when they do they don't sit very still. So the traditional m.o. for painting people is to know how to paint a generic person, which you then modify to match the specific person you're painting. Whereas a still life you can, if you want, copy pixel by pixel from what you're seeing. You don't want to stop there, of course, or you get merely photographic accuracy, and what makes a still life interesting is that it's been through a head. You want to emphasize the visual cues that tell you, for example, that the reason the color changes suddenly at a certain point is that it's the edge of an object. By subtly emphasizing such things you can make paintings that are more realistic than photographs not just in some metaphorical sense, but in the strict information-theoretic sense.","chunk_id":"134ea1327b6f0be1efeb9c0d15c86020"}

{"question":"How can programmers expand their concept of programming according to the text?","answer":"Programmers can expand their concept of programming by learning weird languages and focusing on the differences between a weird language and popular languages.","chunk":"So if you want to expand your concept of what programming can be, one way to do it is by learning weird languages. Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smart, and then focus on the differences between this language and the intersection of popular languages. What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? In the process of learning how to say things you couldn't previously say, you'll probably be learning how to think things you couldn't previously think.","chunk_id":"4e6e14e4247ca62a823725b99bcffae6"}

{"question":"Why was it more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects 50 years ago?","answer":"Being part of an organization was essential 50 years ago to access resources, colleagues, and distribution. Your prestige was often tied to the organization you belonged to, and it was a common predictor of success. Exceptions like artists and writers could work independently but still relied on organizations for audience reach.","chunk":"Fifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences.","chunk_id":"dd1b0f38ceb88d9dddc9f273c371ac7c"}

{"question":"What is the most distinctive thing about Y Combinator's batch model according to the text?","answer":"The most distinctive thing about Y Combinator's batch model is funding a group of startups all at once, twice a year, and providing intensive focus and help for three months.","chunk":"The most distinctive thing about YC is the batch model: to fund a bunch of startups all at once, twice a year, and then to spend three months focusing intensively on trying to help them. That part we discovered by accident, not merely implicitly but explicitly due to our ignorance about investing. We needed to get experience as investors. What better way, we thought, than to fund a whole bunch of startups at once? We knew undergrads got temporary jobs at tech companies during the summer. Why not organize a summer program where they'd start startups instead? We wouldn't feel guilty for being in a sense fake investors, because they would in a similar sense be fake founders. So while we probably wouldn't make much money out of it, we'd at least get to practice being investors on them, and they for their part would probably have a more interesting summer than they would working at Microsoft.","chunk_id":"456466345f437c0bf186511a9e4636b7"}

Maybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, it won't seem right to put these two businesses in the same category.

Russell translated McCarthy's interpreter into IBM 704 machine language, and from that point Lisp started also to be a programming language in the ordinary sense.

{"question":"Why did so few people get rich from starting companies in 1982 according to the text?","answer":"The wave of consolidation sweeping through the American economy in 1982, led by financiers like J. P. Morgan, combined smaller companies into larger ones with economies of scale. This trend, along with government-backed cartels and oligopolistic corporations dominating the economy by the end of World War II, hindered the ability of people to get rich from starting companies.","chunk":"So it's not 2020 that's the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question is why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in 1982. And the answer is that even as the Herald Tribune's list was being compiled, a wave of consolidation was sweeping through the American economy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, financiers like J. P. Morgan combined thousands of smaller companies into a few hundred giant ones with commanding economies of scale. By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind writes, \"the major sectors of the economy were either organized as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic corporations.\"","chunk_id":"51741faa542ea6a9fca7c784e191fefd"}

It was as weird as it sounds. I resumed all my old patterns, except now there were doors where there hadn't been. Now when I was tired of walking, all I had to do was raise my hand, and (unless it was raining) a taxi would stop to pick me up. Now when I walked past charming little restaurants I could go in and order lunch. It was exciting for a while. Painting started to go better. I experimented with a new kind of still life where I'd paint one painting in the old way, then photograph it and print it, blown up, on canvas, and then use that as the underpainting for a second still life, painted from the same objects (which hopefully hadn't rotted yet).","chunk_id":"96c91997312c7bac5cc78e6bcf2372ba"}

The foundation had merely been intro stuff, and the Accademia had been a (very civilized) joke. Now I was going to see what real art school was like. But alas it was more like the Accademia than not. Better organized, certainly, and a lot more expensive, but it was now becoming clear that art school did not bear the same relationship to art that medical school bore to medicine. At least not the painting department. The textile department, which my next door neighbor belonged to, seemed to be pretty rigorous. No doubt illustration and architecture were too. But painting was post-rigorous.

I told him all about the kinds of pictures I wanted to paint. At the time I was touched that he took such an interest in me. Now I realize it was because he thought I was lying. My options at that point were worth about $2 million a month. If I was leaving that kind of money on the table, it could only be to go and start some new startup, and if I did, I might take people with me.

{"question":"How does the public expression of heresies differ from ordinary opinions according to the text?","answer":"The public expression of heresies outweighs everything else the speaker has done, unlike in ordinary opinions where you're judged by the average of your opinions.","chunk":"The other distinctive thing about heresies, compared to ordinary opinions, is that the public expression of them outweighs everything else the speaker has done. In ordinary matters, like knowledge of history, or taste in music, you're judged by the average of your opinions. A heresy is qualitatively different. It's like dropping a chunk of uranium onto the scale.","chunk_id":"982119a2a8e184fb82441c7f73254017"}
{"question":"What was the author's clearest memory regarding the 1401?","answer":"The author's clearest memory regarding the 1401 was the moment they learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of their programs didn't on the machine without time-sharing.","chunk":"I was puzzled by the 1401. I couldn't figure out what to do with it. And in retrospect there's not much I could have done with it. The only form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I didn't have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculate approximations of pi, but I didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type. So I'm not surprised I can't remember any programs I wrote, because they can't have done much. My clearest memory is of the moment I learned it was possible for programs not to terminate, when one of mine didn't. On a machine without time-sharing, this was a social as well as a technical error, as the data center manager's expression made clear.","chunk_id":"65c6f3ed506a3f844346e5bd8fe8962f"}
{"question":"What happens when a large number of aggressively conventional-minded people unite behind an ideology, according to the text?","answer":"When a large number of aggressively conventional-minded people unite behind an ideology, they become more of a problem due to a mob dynamic where the enthusiasm of each participant is increased by the enthusiasm of the others.","chunk":"Normally they're only locally visible. They're the grumpy, censorious people in a group — the ones who are always first to complain when something violates the current rules of propriety. But occasionally, like a vector field whose elements become aligned, a large number of aggressively conventional-minded people unite behind some ideology all at once. Then they become much more of a problem, because a mob dynamic takes over, where the enthusiasm of each participant is increased by the enthusiasm of the others.","chunk_id":"4cf2cab2cb7f7b4398dcb8c24c4c2260"}

To find out, we decided to try making a version of our store builder that you could control through the browser. A couple days later, on August 12, we had one that worked.

You do it the same way you get good at the violin or football: practice.

{"question":"What was the author's experience like when trying to sign up art galleries for their online services?","answer":"The author's experience of signing up art galleries for their online services was challenging and difficult, with most galleries not willing to pay for the services.","chunk":"If I wanted to get rich, here was the next train leaving the station. I was right about that part. What I got wrong was the idea. I decided we should start a company to put art galleries online. I can't honestly say, after reading so many Y Combinator applications, that this was the worst startup idea ever, but it was up there. Art galleries didn't want to be online, and still don't, not the fancy ones. That's not how they sell. I wrote some software to generate web sites for galleries, and Robert wrote some to resize images and set up an http server to serve the pages. Then we tried to sign up galleries. To call this a difficult sale would be an understatement. It was difficult to give away. A few galleries let us make sites for them for free, but none paid us.","chunk_id":"f921aebdf04099958a917fea23cca845"}

Once you're good at some technology, when you look at the world you see dotted outlines around the things that are missing.

{"question":"Why does the text argue that 'seek thresholds' and 'seek competition' heuristics may not be useful in certain situations?","answer":"The text argues that 'seek thresholds' and 'seek competition' may not be useful because the existence of a threshold or competition does not guarantee that the game or outcome is worth pursuing. For example, playing Russian roulette may have a threshold, but the best case scenario does not lead to a favorable outcome. Similarly, 'seek competition' is deemed useless if the prize at stake is not worth competing for. The text emphasizes that sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of return curves, regardless of the presence of thresholds.","chunk":"What about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the form \"seek thresholds\" or \"seek competition?\" Here the situation is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette, you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the best case you're no better off. \"Seek competition\" is similarly useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve — because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it's trivially small at first — but thresholds only guarantee the shape.","chunk_id":"db822496ffae6ad17a6e0f0307aa55da"}

{"question":"What were some reasons for the breakup of big companies by 1970 according to the text?","answer":"Partly senescence, slackness, bloating, and insulation from market forces were some reasons for the breakup of big companies by 1970 as mentioned in the text. The federal government's realization of issues and the subsequent deregulation process also played a role in breaking up these companies.","chunk":"Why did it break up? Partly senescence. The big companies that seemed models of scale and efficiency in 1930 had by 1970 become slack and bloated. By 1970 the rigid structure of the economy was full of cosy nests that various groups had built to insulate themselves from market forces. During the Carter administration the federal government realized something was amiss and began, in a process they called \"deregulation,\" to roll back the policies that propped up the oligopolies.","chunk_id":"04a16e6a5749ed12ff264f5d91808c3c"}

A company with only a few employees would have seemed unprofessional.","chunk":"Alas I hired lots more people, partly because our investors wanted me to, and partly because that's what startups did during the Internet Bubble. A company with just a handful of employees would have seemed amateurish. So we didn't reach breakeven until about when Yahoo bought us in the summer of 1998. Which in turn meant we were at the mercy of investors for the entire life of the company.

The sign has been there for several years.

{"question":"What was the motivation behind creating Y Combinator (YC) according to the text?","answer":"YC was designed to be exactly what the founders wanted when they were starting a startup.","chunk":"Colleagues and startup founders are two of the most powerful forces in the world, so you'd expect it to have a big effect to combine them. Before YC, to the extent people thought about the question at all, most assumed they couldn't be combined — that loneliness was the price of independence. That was how it felt to us when we started our own startup in Boston in the 1990s. We had a handful of older people we could go to for advice (of varying quality), but no peers. There was no one we could commiserate with about the misbehavior of investors, or speculate with about the future of technology. I often tell founders to make something they themselves want, and YC is certainly that: it was designed to be exactly what we wanted when we were starting a startup.","chunk_id":"a14b627826bc68508a8c109c186bcf74"}

{"question":"Why is focus crucial for early stage startups according to the text?","answer":"Focus is crucial for early stage startups because they have limited resources and need to prioritize important problems. If founders focus on unimportant matters, there is a risk of neglecting critical issues that require attention. The essence of YC's approach is to identify the most significant problems, generate solutions quickly, and measure their effectiveness.","chunk":"Focus is doubly important for early stage startups, because not only do they have a hundred different problems, they don't have anyone to work on them except the founders. If the founders focus on things that don't matter, there's no one focusing on the things that do. So the essence of what happens at YC is to figure out which problems matter most, then cook up ideas for solving them — ideally at a resolution of a week or less — and then try those ideas and measure how well they worked. The focus is on action, with measurable, near-term results.","chunk_id":"d7a28b5fdf21b97c05ea7c8e59f6104f"}

Luck is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component of true chance that you can't do anything about.

The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400 didn't win by making better technology. They won by being really driven and good at making deals.

This is not only because of the increased number of companies being evaluated but also due to the higher likelihood of encountering issues and challenges.","chunk":"That's one advantage of funding large numbers of early stage companies rather than smaller numbers of later-stage ones.

The founders of Twitch met when they were seven. The founders of Stripe, Patrick and John Collison, met when John was born. But universities are the main source of cofounders. And because they're where the cofounders are, they're also where the ideas are, because the best ideas grow out of projects you do with the people who become your cofounders.","chunk_id":"708d5f638252ac76efe52388ffb7df2e"}
{"question":"What is a signature style in art and how does it impact the value of an artwork?","answer":"A signature style in art is the visual equivalent of a 'schtick' in show business, serving as a unique identifier of an artist's work. It helps differentiate the artist from others. This distinct style can increase the value of an artwork, as buyers are often willing to pay more for pieces with a recognizable and unique style.","chunk":"A signature style is the visual equivalent of what in show business is known as a \"schtick\": something that immediately identifies the work as yours and no one else's. For example, when you see a painting that looks like a certain kind of cartoon, you know it's by Roy Lichtenstein.

{"question":"Why does the text suggest doing well in classes to get into a good university for starting a startup?","answer":"The text suggests doing well in classes to get into a good university for starting a startup because the best cofounders and employees often come from top universities, such as Stanford, where Larry and Sergey hired the smartest people to start Google.","chunk":"At this point I'm going to tell you something you might not want to hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even the ones that are just memorization or blathering about literature, because you need to do well in your classes to get into a good university. And if you want to start a startup you should try to get into the best university you can, because that's where the best cofounders are. It's also where the best employees are. When Larry and Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartest people they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage for them.","chunk_id":"bd9da83d7d9b078854442d208ac2de3d"}
{"question":"Why do tech companies make candidates take a coding test before hiring them, regardless of their university education or academic performance?","answer":"Tech companies make candidates take a coding test before hiring them because they believe that grades and exam results do not necessarily reflect one's programming abilities. They want to assess the candidate's actual programming skills and capabilities.","chunk":"Those of you who are taking computer science classes in school may at this point be thinking, ok, we've got this sorted. We're already being taught all about programming. But sorry, this is not enough. You have to be working on your own projects, not just learning stuff in classes. You can do well in computer science classes without ever really learning to program. In fact you can graduate with a degree in computer science from a top university and still not be any good at programming. That's why tech companies all make you take a coding test before they'll hire you, regardless of where you went to university or how well you did there. They know grades and exam results prove nothing.","chunk_id":"1db1f51732c41c249f1e5297d0b66acb"}

It had a very strong component of moral purity, and the aggressively conventional-minded seized upon it with their usual eagerness — all the more because the relaxation of social norms in the preceding decades meant there had been less and less to forbid.

If you correct course at a high enough frequency, you can be simultaneously decisive at a micro scale and tentative at a macro scale. The result is a somewhat winding path, but executed very rapidly, like the path a running back takes downfield. And in practice there's less backtracking than you might expect.

It wasn't obvious at the time. It's never obvious. If it was obviously a good idea to start Apple or Google or Facebook, someone else would have already done it. That's why the best startups grow out of projects that aren't meant to be startups. You're not trying to start a company. You're just following your instincts about what's interesting.

{"question":"Why did Viaweb set their pricing for ecommerce software at $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one?","answer":"Viaweb set their pricing low at $100 for a small store and $300 for a big one because they were not familiar with what businesses paid for such services, and their limited financial resources influenced their decision to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than they realized.","chunk":"There were a lot of startups making ecommerce software in the second half of the 90s. We were determined to be the Microsoft Word, not the Interleaf. Which meant being easy to use and inexpensive. It was lucky for us that we were poor, because that caused us to make Viaweb even more inexpensive than we realized. We charged $100 a month for a small store and $300 a month for a big one. This low price was a big attraction, and a constant thorn in the sides of competitors, but it wasn't because of some clever insight that we set the price low.

{"question":"What challenges did the author face while working at Interleaf?","answer":"The author faced challenges in understanding the software at Interleaf due to their lack of proficiency in C and their disinterest in learning it. Additionally, they found the traditional concept of a programming job with set working hours unnatural, and they spent time working on 'On Lisp' secretly.","chunk":"Interleaf had done something pretty bold. Inspired by Emacs, they'd added a scripting language, and even made the scripting language a dialect of Lisp. Now they wanted a Lisp hacker to write things in it. This was the closest thing I've had to a normal job, and I hereby apologize to my boss and coworkers, because I was a bad employee. Their Lisp was the thinnest icing on a giant C cake, and since I didn't know C and didn't want to learn it, I never understood most of the software. Plus I was terribly irresponsible. This was back when a programming job meant showing up every day during certain working hours. That seemed unnatural to me, and on this point the rest of the world is coming around to my way of thinking, but at the time it caused a lot of friction. Toward the end of the year I spent much of my time surreptitiously working on On Lisp, which I had by this time gotten a contract to publish.","chunk_id":"0405df77c94b1fb3ea9f9656a66a0ee8"}

Though the trend in freedom of expression has been bad over the last decade, it's been good over the longer term. And there are signs that the current wave of intolerance is peaking. Independent-minded people I talk to seem more confident than they did a few years ago. On the other side, even some of the leaders are starting to wonder if things have gone too far.

They'll come in to talk about three problems they're worrying about. One is of moderate importance, one doesn't matter at all, and one will kill the company if it isn't addressed immediately.

{"question":"Why did Robert recommend Trevor Blackwell as a programmer to the narrator?","answer":"Robert recommended Trevor Blackwell as a programmer because he was known to be frighteningly effective hacker despite his unusual method of organizing his life with notecards.","chunk":"In September, Robert rebelled. \"We've been working on this for a month,\" he said, \"and it's still not done.\" This is funny in retrospect, because he would still be working on it almost 3 years later. But I decided it might be prudent to recruit more programmers, and I asked Robert who else in grad school with him was really good. He recommended Trevor Blackwell, which surprised me at first, because at that point I knew Trevor mainly for his plan to reduce everything in his life to a stack of notecards, which he carried around with him. But Rtm was right, as usual. Trevor turned out to be a frighteningly effective hacker.","chunk_id":"eda2a26edcf535e4c9582364abad74c0"}
{"question":"What is the author's main goal in the essay regarding heresy and free expression?","answer":"The author's main goal in the essay is to form social antibodies against the concept of heresy and to push back against efforts to suppress ideas, ultimately aiming to disable the concept of heresy.","chunk":"So it's probably worth spending some amount of effort on pushing back to keep open the window of free expression. My hope is that this essay will help form social antibodies not just against current efforts to suppress ideas, but against the concept of heresy in general. That's the real prize. How do you disable the concept of heresy? Since the Enlightenment, western societies have discovered many techniques for doing that, but there are surely more to be discovered.","chunk_id":"9edb1c4ad9a0e6770338a5cbd66b5937"}
{"question":"According to the text, in which fields do a few big winners outperform everyone else, and why does this phenomenon occur in sports and politics?","answer":"A few fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else are sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. The phenomenon occurs in sports due to externally imposed thresholds, where a small percentage difference can lead to winning every race. In politics, power grows similarly to the days of emperors.","chunk":"What are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be independent-minded to succeed — where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel as well.","chunk_id":"f45005c5c4cee7ea4ae0f298e8576b23"}
{"question":"According to the text, what is the significance of being the \"entry level\" option?","answer":"Being the entry level option is important because the low end consumes the high end. If one is not the entry level option, they risk being overtaken by competitors who will squash them against the ceiling, indicating the danger of losing out in the market.","chunk":"But the most important thing I learned, and which I used in both Viaweb and Y Combinator, is that the low end eats the high end: that it's good to be the \"entry level\" option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you're not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling. Which in turn means that prestige is a danger sign.","chunk_id":"1c9313b6afdb25f09631bdac83d2ed61"}
{"question":"Why do donors often make restricted donations even though they do less good than unrestricted ones according to the text?","answer":"Donors often make restricted donations because they have motives other than doing good, such as making a mark, generating publicity, or complying with regulations. Some donors may not be aware of the distinction between restricted and unrestricted donations, believing that donating money for a specific purpose is how donation works. Nonprofits also don't actively discourage restricted donations due to financial constraints.","chunk":"If restricted donations do less good than unrestricted ones, why do donors so often make them? Partly because doing good isn't donors' only motive. They often have other motives as well — to make a mark, or to generate good publicity, or to comply with regulations or corporate policies. Many donors may simply never have considered the distinction between restricted and unrestricted donations. They may believe that donating money for some specific purpose is just how donation works. And to be fair, nonprofits don't try very hard to discourage such illusions. They can't afford to. People running nonprofits are almost always anxious about money. They can't afford to talk back to big donors.","chunk_id":"7deb11c176b3d25a382184627006f73a"}
{"question":"What is the significance of Lisp macros according to the text?","answer":"Lisp macros are considered unusual even among Lisp programmers and are challenging to implement outside of Lisp, as they can require turning the language into a Lisp dialect. They represent advanced techniques in programming, such as creating specialized problem-solving languages and applications within them, showcasing a broader space of program-manipulating techniques that are not fully explored.","chunk":"A concrete example: Lisp macros. Lisp macros seem weird even to many Lisp programmers. They're not only not in the intersection of popular languages, but by their nature would be hard to implement properly in a language without turning it into a dialect of Lisp. And macros are definitely evidence of techniques that go beyond glue programming. For example, solving problems by first writing a language for problems of that type, and then writing your specific application in it. Nor is this all you can do with macros; it's just one region in a space of program-manipulating techniques that even now is far from fully explored.","chunk_id":"5280a9384a8c53079d56c176ec3c8202"}
{"question":"What problem did Mark Zuckerberg identify at Harvard in 2002, and how did he propose to solve it?","answer":"Mark Zuckerberg noticed the absence of a centralized online directory for Harvard. He proposed to fix this by creating a program that allowed users to upload their photos and consolidating the data into a new website for the entire university.","chunk":"So Mark Zuckerberg shows up at Harvard in 2002, and the university still hasn't gotten the facebook online. Each individual house has an online facebook, but there isn't one for the whole university. The university administration has been diligently having meetings about this, and will probably have solved the problem in another decade or so. Most of the students don't consciously notice that anything is wrong. But Mark is a programmer. He looks at this situation and thinks \"Well, this is stupid. I could write a program to fix this in one night. Just let people upload their own photos and then combine the data into a new site for the whole university.\" So he does. And almost literally overnight he has thousands of users.","chunk_id":"89e2387b62ad20b76b1af5196c84160d"}
{"question":"What was the author's experience like in the painting department at the Accademia?","answer":"The author's experience in the painting department at the Accademia involved a lack of teaching and learning, with an arrangement between students and faculty where no teaching was required from the faculty and no learning was required from the students. The studio atmosphere included a nude model for painting, with most students spending time chatting or imitating things from American art magazines, except for the author who painted the nude model.","chunk":"I'm only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn't require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn't require the students to learn anything. And at the same time all involved would adhere outwardly to the conventions of a 19th century atelier. We actually had one of those little stoves, fed with kindling, that you see in 19th century studio paintings, and a nude model sitting as close to it as possible without getting burned. Except hardly anyone else painted her besides me. The rest of the students spent their time chatting or occasionally trying to imitate things they'd seen in American art magazines.","chunk_id":"e3758e684c3d8fff4f35f0027bafd158"}
{"question":"Who were some of the notable individuals funded in the first batch of the Summer Founders Program according to the text?","answer":"Some of the notable individuals funded in the first batch of the Summer Founders Program included Reddit, Justin Kan, Emmett Shear, Aaron Swartz, and Sam Altman.","chunk":"We invited about 20 of the 225 groups to interview in person, and from those we picked 8 to fund. They were an impressive group. That first batch included reddit, Justin Kan and Emmett Shear, who went on to found Twitch, Aaron Swartz, who had already helped write the RSS spec and would a few years later become a martyr for open access, and Sam Altman, who would later become the second president of YC. I don't think it was entirely luck that the first batch was so good. You had to be pretty bold to sign up for a weird thing like the Summer Founders Program instead of a summer job at a legit place like Microsoft or Goldman Sachs.","chunk_id":"0149f35b43cc1f94ae121fe191a67462"}
{"question":"What specific novel by Heinlein influenced the author's interest in AI?","answer":"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress","chunk":"AI was in the air in the mid 1980s, but there were two things especially that made me want to work on it: a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. I haven't tried rereading The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, so I don't know how well it has aged, but when I read it I was drawn entirely into its world. It seemed only a matter of time before we'd have Mike, and when I saw Winograd using SHRDLU, it seemed like that time would be a few years at most. All you had to do was teach SHRDLU more words.","chunk_id":"2c15a0d50f7eca4257fcfcced7e58adc"}
{"question":"What is the point of the idea of alien truth according to the text?","answer":"The point of the idea of alien truth is to provide a threshold or target for truth, especially in the search for general truths shared with other forms of intelligent life.","chunk":"We can only guess, of course. We can't say for sure what forms intelligent life might take. Nor is it my goal here to explore that question, interesting though it is. The point of the idea of alien truth is not that it gives us a way to speculate about what forms intelligent life might take, but that it gives us a threshold, or more precisely a target, for truth. If you're trying to find the most general truths short of those of math or physics, then presumably they'll be those we'd share in common with other forms of intelligent life.","chunk_id":"688e29b95fc332029b872d6a79145ae3"}
{"question":"According to the text, what is the goal of philosophy in relation to alien truths?","answer":"The goal of philosophy, as mentioned in the text, is to explore ideas based on alien truths without being constrained by certainty.","chunk":"We may one day have something like alien life among us in the form of AIs. And that may in turn allow us to be precise about what truths an intelligent being would have to share with us. We might find, for example, that it's impossible to create something we'd consider intelligent that doesn't use Occam's razor. We might one day even be able to prove that. But though this sort of research would be very interesting, it's not necessary for our purposes, or even the same field; the goal of philosophy, if we're going to call it that, would be to see what ideas we come up with using alien truth as a target, not to say precisely where the threshold of it is. Those two questions might one day converge, but they'll converge from quite different directions, and till they do, it would be too constraining to restrict ourselves to thinking only about things we're certain would be alien truths. Especially since this will probably be one of those areas where the best guesses turn out to be surprisingly close to optimal. (Let's see if that one does.)","chunk_id":"b094f26bf82ffdf2413bcebe69a66b28"}
{"question":"What was the initial part of Y Combinator that the founders established first?","answer":"To be an angel firm.","chunk":"There are multiple components to Y Combinator, and we didn't figure them all out at once. The part we got first was to be an angel firm. In those days, those two words didn't go together. There were VC firms, which were organized companies with people whose job it was to make investments, but they only did big, million dollar investments. And there were angels, who did smaller investments, but these were individuals who were usually focused on other things and made investments on the side. And neither of them helped founders enough in the beginning. We knew how helpless founders were in some respects, because we remembered how helpless we'd been. For example, one thing Julian had done for us that seemed to us like magic was to get us set up as a company. We were fine writing fairly difficult software, but actually getting incorporated, with bylaws and stock and all that stuff, how on earth did you do that? Our plan was not only to make seed investments, but to do for startups everything Julian had done for us.","chunk_id":"b06f7b99d5163c4b0fb07367aee870b1"}
{"question":"How did the author perceive schoolwork like writing papers and programming in CS classes?","answer":"The author viewed schoolwork like writing papers and programming in CS classes as personal projects that became a part of their own pursuits, with the exception of English classes where the tasks were considered less engaging.","chunk":"There are occasionally times when schoolwork becomes a project of one's own. Whenever I had to write a paper, that would become a project of my own — except in English classes, ironically, because the things one has to write in English classes are so bogus. And when I got to college and started taking CS classes, the programs I had to write became projects of my own. Whenever I was writing or programming, I was usually skating, and that has been true ever since.","chunk_id":"b55817279277555e712b129b3ad08b41"}
